//! Pointer cells: store-to-load forwarding through closed allocas.
//!
//! A pointer stored into an alloca and loaded back is, without this, a pointer loaded from
//! memory: `Dynamic`, resolved at run time through the resident set, which Profile F lacks and
//! which no handle, arena, or buffer-table pointer can take. When every access to the alloca is
//! visible, the loaded pointer is instead one of the pointers stored at its slot, so its fact is
//! the join of theirs, and the cell holds each pointer in its lowered representation
//! (`lower::access::cell`).
//!
//! **Slots.** A pointer access into a cell lands at its exact byte offset ([`Slot::At`]) or, when
//! the offset is not a translation-time constant, anywhere ([`Slot::Any`]). A load at `o` reads the
//! pointers stored at `o` and at `Any`; a load at `Any` reads every slot of the cell.
//!
//! **Closure.** The analysis first assumes every alloca forwards, runs the fixpoint, and then
//! verifies each alloca against the final facts ([`verify`]). An alloca is **open** (its pointer
//! loads stay `Dynamic`) when some instruction reaches it other than through address arithmetic
//! (`getelementptr`, casts, `phi`, `select`, `freeze`), a plain load or store address, a memory
//! intrinsic's operand (`memset`, `memcpy`, `memmove`: its bytes are a data access), a compare,
//! or a pointer stored into a forwarding cell: an atomic, any other call, `ptrtoint`, an
//! aggregate holding it, a load or store of an aggregate that holds pointers, or a store of its
//! pointer into other memory. It is open too when its slots are not disciplined: two pointer
//! slots overlap, one slot is accessed as two pointer types, a pointer access at an unknown
//! offset meets any data access, a data access (a load or store of a non-pointer, a memory
//! intrinsic's bytes) overlaps a pointer slot, or a data access's bytes are not
//! translation-time constants. And every alloca is open when some access goes through a
//! thread-space pointer that may be `Dynamic` (it may alias any alloca). A verification that opens allocas reruns the fixpoint
//! with them open; a second one opens every alloca, so the analysis runs at most three rounds.
//!
//! **Slot copies**. A `memcpy` or `memmove` of a translation-time constant length between two
//! pointers into forwarding cells at constant offsets moves each source pointer slot that lies
//! wholly inside the copied bytes to the destination slot at the same distance from the copy's
//! start: the destination slot holds the source slot's pointers, and the copy's other bytes are
//! data copied onto data. Such a copy keeps both cells closed when no pointer access of either is
//! at an unknown offset, no slot straddles either end of the copied bytes, and every destination
//! slot inside them is a slot of every source cell at the same distance and of the same type
//! ([`settle_copies`]). The lowered copy moves the arena bytes that hold each slot's lowered
//! representation (`lower::access::copy`), which the destination's loads read as their own:
//! provenance joins the copied pointers into the destination slot's loads (their roots and
//! classes), so the representations agree as a store's and its loads' do. Any other copy is a
//! data access of its bytes, as above. This is MPS's `_MPSNDArrays` shape: a struct holding a
//! buffer-table pointer, copied whole into the struct each kernel call takes.
//!
//! **Pointer bits**. A `ptrtoint` of a pointer to an integer of the pointer's store size, every use
//! of which is the value of a plain store ([`bit_stores`]), moves the pointer's bits into memory
//! and nowhere else. When every one of those stores lands in forwarding cells, each is a store of
//! the pointer: the slot holds the pointer (its lowered representation), and the integer is never
//! observed ([`CellFacts::bits`]). Otherwise the stores are data and the `ptrtoint` reaches the
//! pointer's memory, as above. Likewise a plain integer load of a pointer's store size whose every
//! use is an `inttoptr` to a pointer of that size ([`word_loads`]) reads a pointer's bits and only
//! turns them back into the pointer: through a forwarding cell it is a load of the slot's pointer,
//! each `inttoptr` that pointer ([`CellFacts::words`]), as the round trip is through a handle
//! array. And a plain integer load of that size whose every use is the value of a plain store of it
//! ([`bit_copies`]) copies the bytes it reads to each store's address: between forwarding cells at
//! constant offsets it is a slot copy of 8 bytes, as a `memcpy` of them is.
//!
//! A load from a slot that no store reaches reads an undefined pointer: the null root (a valid
//! refinement), assigned once the facts are settled so a transiently empty slot never adds it.
//!
//! **Zero fills**. A `memset` of zero bytes of a translation-time constant length into forwarding
//! cells at a constant offset ([`zero_fill`]) writes null over every pointer slot it covers: zero
//! bytes read back as null in every lowered representation, so the fill is not a data access of its
//! bytes. The analysis is flow-insensitive: a load from a slot that a zero fill covers reads null
//! as well as every pointer stored there, and a load at an unknown offset reads null when its cell
//! has any zero bytes. A slot copy moves the zero bytes inside the copied bytes to the destination
//! at the same distance from the copy's start. Such a fill keeps its cells closed when it covers
//! each pointer slot wholly or not at all and no pointer access of the cell is at an unknown offset
//! ([`disciplined`]); any other `memset` is a data access, as above. The lowered fill writes the
//! zero bytes as it would into any private memory.
