//! Structurization (DTS P0–P9).
//!
//! The structurizer reads an entry's control-flow graph through [`CfgView`] and never touches the
//! AIR instructions: blocks are opaque `Code(BlockId)` units, terminators are [`TermShape`]s, and
//! the only per-block fact it needs besides the edges is whether the block holds a tangled
//! (convergent) instruction. Demotion types come from the Plan.
//!
//! # Passes
//!
//! [`structurize`] runs P0–P7 and returns a [`tree::Structured`]; [`prepare`] runs the CFG-level
//! passes P0–P2 alone and returns a [`Prepared`] working graph:
//!
//! - **P0** ([`prune`]): copy the reachable blocks into a [`cfg::StructCfg`], fold `CondBr(c,t,t)`
//!   to `Br(t)`, group switch literals by target.
//! - **P1** ([`irreducible`]): multi-entry dispatch until the graph is reducible,
//!   refusing tangled irreducible regions (`IrreducibleConvergent`), nesting deeper than
//!   `Limit::IrreducibleDepth`, and output above `Limit::OutputBlocks`.
//! - **P2** ([`loops`]): the loop nest of the reducible graph, its natural loops.
//! - **P3** is retired: no loop-exit tail joins its loop. AGX runs a tail
//!   after the loop it leaves, with every invocation that left through it, and so does P5's exit
//!   dispatch.
//!
//! Then, over [`Prepared`]:
//!
//! - **P4** ([`demote`]): one `Function` variable per block-crossing value and per phi (the
//!   demotion plan; P8 emits the loads and stores).
//! - **P5** ([`normalize`]): canonical loops: back edges become `Continue`, exits
//!   `SetExit; Break` with one exit dispatch per loop.
//! - **P6** ([`regions`]): Ramsey dominator-tree placement of every acyclic region, innermost
//!   loop first, with `Block`/`Jump` for forward jumps.
//! - **P7** ([`pending`]): tail jumps fall out; other jumps go through one `pending` variable.
//!
//! The output size is checked against `Limit::OutputBlocks` (`4(n+e)+1024` for the pruned
//! graph) before anything is emitted. P8/P9 (emit and promote) consume [`tree::Structured`].
//!
//! # Budget
//!
//! Every pass takes the per-attempt [`Meter`]: work is ticked at every input-scaled loop, every
//! input-scaled container is charged before it is reserved, and a pass that fails leaves the
//! ledger as it found it. [`Prepared::release`] returns what the result keeps charged.

// Panic-lint policy for the new core: product code in this tree may not unwrap or index unchecked;
// tests are exempt.
