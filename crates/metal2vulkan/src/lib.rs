// `too_many_arguments` and `type_complexity` are threshold heuristics that fire pervasively and
// benignly across this translator: lowering and canonicalization functions legitimately thread many
// typed parameters, and their return and table shapes are genuinely nested domain types. Factoring
// every such signature behind a wrapper struct or a one-off `type` alias would add indirection
// without improving clarity, so both are accepted crate-wide rather than scattered per-site.

// The re-architected core. Its public modules are the API: `error`, `device`, `library`,
// `reflection`, `pipeline`, `bind`, `cache`, `metal`, `vk`, and `ash_interop` under feature `ash`,
// with `Budget` and `CancelToken` at the root. The AIR front end is the `metal2vulkan-air` crate, a
// documented library of its own that validation depends on directly; this crate names it `air`, and
// its `budget` and `graph` modules at its root, as when they were modules here, all crate-private.
// The translator core (`lower`, `memory`, `spirv`, `structurize`) and every submodule of a public
// module are crate-private: nothing outside the crate reaches them, this workspace's validation and
// dev tools included.
//
// `tests/api_surface.rs` pins which crate-root items are which.
