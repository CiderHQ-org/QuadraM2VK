//! The meter charges by its input alone.
//!
//! Work units and ledger bytes decide whether an input near a cap translates or is refused with
//! `LimitExceeded`, a refusal permanent for the input. So, like the output, they must be a function
//! of the bitcode, the entry, and the profile: never of hash seeds, addresses, or what the process
//! compiled before. Rust seeds each `HashMap`'s hasher differently, two maps in one process
//! included, so compiling one input twice in one process exposes a charge that follows iteration
//! order or an address, as `deterministic_output_tests` does for output. The second compile also
//! runs after the first has warmed whatever the process keeps.
//!
//! Every entry of every public fixture is compiled twice on two committed profiles (the floor and
//! the most capable), and both compiles must charge the same work units and ledger peak and give
//! the same artifact or the same refusal. `llvm-as` assembles the fixtures (a typed-pointer
//! `.air.ll` goes through `xcrun metal-as`); a fixture whose assembler is missing or rejects it is
//! skipped visibly.
