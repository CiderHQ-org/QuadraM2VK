//! The device replay's generated-commands path: where the consumer enabled
//! `VK_EXT_device_generated_commands` with compute pipeline binding
//! ([`Device::generated_commands`]), the same preprocess writes a token stream in place of the
//! per-variant arguments, and the consumer records one `vkCmdExecuteGeneratedCommandsEXT` per
//! possible segment in place of a dispatch per command, region, and variant.
//!
//! **The sequences.** One per (command, region), in command order then region order
//! ([`GeneratedLayout::sequence_offset`]), each [`GeneratedLayout::stride`] bytes of three tokens:
//!
//! 1. at [`GeneratedLayout::INDEX_OFFSET`], an `EXECUTION_SET` token's `u32`: the index of the
//!    region's variant in the indirect execution set, which holds the registered variants in
//!    their order (0 for a region that runs nothing);
//! 2. at [`GeneratedLayout::PUSH_OFFSET`], a `PUSH_CONSTANT` token's
//!    [`GeneratedLayout::push_bytes`]: the variant's push bytes (its template, [`GeneratedReplay`])
//!    with its `RootTableAddress` the command's slot table, its `ReplayRegionAddress` the region's
//!    record, and its `ExecutionStatusAddress` the status, as K14c's path pushes them;
//! 3. at [`GeneratedLayout::dispatch_offset`], a `DISPATCH` token's `VkDispatchIndirectCommand`:
//!    the region's group count, as K14c's arguments give the selected variant, or zero.
//!
//! **The segments.** A command whose record sets the barrier waits for every earlier command; the
//! others of a segment may run concurrently, as Metal's do. Commands `s` with `s` a multiple of
//! [`GeneratedLayout::segment_commands`] start a segment too, so one execution runs at most that
//! many commands (an added barrier is one more valid schedule) and the preprocess memory the
//! executions reserve stays linear in the commands. Per command `s` the preprocess writes the
//! sequence count of the execution that starts there ([`GeneratedLayout::count_offset`]): its
//! segment's commands times the regions where `s` starts one, 0 elsewhere. It reads at most
//! `segment_commands - 1` later records' barrier words to find the segment's end, so its work per
//! command stays bounded.
//!
//! **Recording** (consumer): per command `s` in range order, a barrier from the previous
//! execution (as K14c's between commands), then `vkCmdExecuteGeneratedCommandsEXT` with
//! `indirectAddress` the scratch plus `sequence_offset(s, 0)`, `sequenceCountAddress` the scratch
//! plus `count_offset(s)`, `maxSequenceCount` [`GeneratedLayout::max_sequences`]`(s)`, and
//! preprocess memory of its own (`vkGetGeneratedCommandsMemoryRequirementsEXT` for that count).
//! The indirect commands layout is the three tokens at those offsets with that stride, its
//! pipeline layout [`GeneratedReplay::pipeline_layout`]: every variant's pipeline is created with
//! it (`VK_PIPELINE_CREATE_2_INDIRECT_BINDABLE_BIT_EXT`), the first as the execution set's initial
//! pipeline (bound before each execution) and the others written at their indices. The
//! variants' descriptor sets are bound once: they are one set ([`GeneratedRefusal::Descriptors`]
//! otherwise). A consumer may preprocess the executions apart instead: the indirect commands
//! layout made with `VK_INDIRECT_COMMANDS_LAYOUT_USAGE_EXPLICIT_PREPROCESS_BIT_EXT`, after the
//! preprocess's barrier every execution's `vkCmdPreprocessGeneratedCommandsEXT` with the state it
//! runs with, a barrier, then each execution as above, preprocessed. The runtime does so where the
//! driver's own preprocessing after an execution goes wrong
//! ([`ImplicitPreprocessAfterExecutionSet`]).
//!
//! [`ImplicitPreprocessAfterExecutionSet`]: crate::error::RuntimeDriverDefect::ImplicitPreprocessAfterExecutionSet
//!
//! **Its output is K14c's.** Each command's regions select the same variant with the same push
//! values and group count as K14c's arguments; only the schedule between barriers differs, and a
//! racy command set compares only under a class that admits any order.
