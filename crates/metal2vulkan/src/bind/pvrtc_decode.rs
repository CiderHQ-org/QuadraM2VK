//! A PVRTC texture's texels as Metal decodes them, from its blocks: the texels a decoded twin of
//! the texture holds on a device without the format (every device but Apple's and PowerVR's).
//!
//! **The decode** (PVRTC1, fitted on an Apple M3 Max under macOS 27.0.1, our own probe: every
//! texel of a 256 x 256 texture of seeded random blocks of each of the eight formats read as
//! `float`, equal to this decode's in every channel). A block is a 64-bit little-endian word of
//! 4 x 4 texels (4 bits a pixel) or 8 x 4 (2 bits); the blocks lie row-major and wrap at the
//! level's edges, a level of fewer texels than a block holding one.
//!
//! - **Colors.** Color B is bits 48 to 63: RGB555 where its bit 15 is set, else A3R4G4B4; color A
//!   is bits 32 to 47, its bit 0 the block's mode bit: RGB554 (blue's 4 bits at bits 1 to 4) where
//!   its bit 15 is set, else A3R4G4B3. Each widens to 5-bit channels (a 4-bit one `c << 1 | c >> 3`,
//!   a 3-bit one `c << 2 | c >> 1`) and a 4-bit alpha (`a << 1`, an opaque color's 15).
//! - **Upscale.** Each texel's colors A and B are the bilinear upscale of the four blocks whose
//!   centres (`(w/2, h/2)` in a block of `w` x `h`) surround it: the integer sum `V` of each
//!   channel times the weights, at a scale of `w h`, widened to 8 bits: 4 bits a pixel, RGB
//!   `(V >> 1) + (V >> 6)` and alpha `V + (V >> 4)`; 2 bits, RGB `(V >> 2) + (V >> 7)` and alpha
//!   `(V >> 1) + (V >> 5)`.
//! - **4 bits a pixel.** Each texel's 2-bit index (bits 0 to 31, 2 a texel, row-major) weighs B:
//!   0, 3, 5 or 8 eighths; in mode 1 (punch-through) 0, 4, 4 or 8, index 2 also making alpha 0.
//! - **2 bits a pixel.** In mode 0 each texel has one bit (bits 0 to 31): 0 or 8 eighths. In mode
//!   1 the texels of even `x + y` hold 2-bit values (0, 3, 5 or 8 eighths) on the checkerboard,
//!   row-major; the others take the four neighbours' average `(s + 2) / 4`, or where bit 0 is set
//!   the two horizontal neighbours' `(a + b + 1) / 2` (the vertical ones' where bit 20 is set).
//!   Before the values are read, bit 21 is copied into bit 20 where bit 0 is set, then bit 1 into
//!   bit 0. Neighbours come from the adjacent blocks, wrapping.
//! - **The texel.** Each channel is `(A (8 - w) + B w) / 8`, an 8-bit code; an RGB format's alpha
//!   is 255. Metal reads a code `c / 255`, an sRGB format's color channel through its twelve-bit
//!   table (`k / 4095` for `lower::arith::srgb`'s step `k`).
//!
//! **The twin's texels** are the codes, in `R8G8B8A8_UNORM` ([`PvrtcDecode::texel_format`]),
//! exact: a linear format's read is the code's `c / 255`, and an sRGB format's slot reads them raw
//! through that view and decodes its color through Metal's table
//! (`metal::texel_format::srgb_raw`), as for `RGBA8Unorm_sRGB`. A format's linear and sRGB forms
//! decode to the same codes, so one twin serves the views of both.
//!
//! **The module** ([`pvrtc_decode_module`], one per device and block shape: 2 or 4 bits a pixel,
//! RGB or RGBA). `BlockDecodeModule`'s entry point, local size and bindings: the shape
//! ([`PvrtcDecode::shape`]: a band of a level's rows of some of its images), every block of
//! those images (row-major, each image's after the last, read whole, since each texel's colors
//! come from the blocks around it, wrapping), and the band's texels, written as a copy into the
//! twin reads them. Invocation `(x, y, z)` inside the band's width, rows and images writes texel
//! `(x, first + y)` of image `z`; one outside writes nothing. A write into some blocks changes the
//! texels around them, wrapping at the level's edges: the consumer decodes whole levels.
