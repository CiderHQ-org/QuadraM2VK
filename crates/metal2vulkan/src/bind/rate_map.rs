//! Rasterization-rate maps: the consumer's `MTLRasterizationRateMap`.
//!
//! A function that maps coordinates through a `rasterization_rate_map_decoder` reads its
//! `constant rasterization_rate_map_data &` argument as a buffer of Metal's parameter data, in
//! Apple's layout (`air::canon::rate_map_data` has it). The consumer implements the Metal object
//! with a [`RasterizationRateMap`]: `newRasterizationRateMapWithDescriptor:` is
//! [`RasterizationRateMap::new`] of a [`RateMapDescriptor`]; `physicalSizeForLayer:`,
//! `physicalGranularity`, `screenSize`, and `layerCount` are its accessors;
//! `parameterBufferSizeAndAlign` is [`RasterizationRateMap::parameter_data_size`] (24,624 bytes,
//! Metal's for every map) and [`RasterizationRateMap::PARAMETER_DATA_ALIGNMENT`];
//! `copyParameterDataToBuffer:offset:` writes [`RasterizationRateMap::to_bytes`] at the offset,
//! Metal's bytes; and `mapScreenToPhysicalCoordinates:forLayer:` and
//! `mapPhysicalToScreenCoordinates:forLayer:` are [`RasterizationRateMap::screen_to_physical`] and
//! [`RasterizationRateMap::physical_to_screen`], Apple's CPU arithmetic over those bytes. A
//! shader's answers are [`RasterizationRateMap::shader_screen_to_physical`] and
//! [`RasterizationRateMap::shader_physical_to_screen`], Apple's GPU arithmetic over the same bytes,
//! which differs from the CPU's (the granule of the coordinate plus half a pixel, two roundings
//! where the CPU fuses, denormals flushed, the layer unclamped). Measured on an Apple M4: the bytes
//! of 45 maps, and every CPU and GPU answer probed over them, bit for bit, the sign of a zero
//! included. The translated decoder computes the shader's answers bit for bit in the SPIR-V
//! interpreter, and on a device that reads `float` denormals as Metal does. The buffer is then
//! bound like any other ([`BoundBuffer::Buffer`]).
//!
//! **Compiling a descriptor.** Metal leaves the compiled map to the device: a layer's quality
//! samples "may be rounded up ... depending on hardware support". [`RasterizationRateMap::new`]
//! compiles by Apple M3's rule, measured (24,854 descriptors on macOS 26.7, every tile of the
//! 24,615 it compiles reproduced, the other 239 refused as [`UnpinnedCompile::DenseSamples`]), per
//! axis of screen extent `W` and quality samples `q_0..q_{n-1}`, in `f32` arithmetic:
//!
//! - each sample becomes `Q_i = max(min(q_i + 1/256, 1), 0.01)` (`NaN` reads 1); one sample is
//!   the quality everywhere, and `n ≥ 2` samples are a piecewise linear function with sample `i`
//!   at `i·W/(n-1)`, evaluated at an integer screen coordinate `x < W` as
//!   `Q_k + (Q_{k+1} - Q_k)·(u - k)` for `u = x·(n-1)/W` and `k = min(⌊u⌋, n - 2)`, and as
//!   `Q_{n-1}` from `W` on;
//! - tiles of [`PHYSICAL_GRANULARITY`] (`G` = 32) physical pixels are laid from screen 0: tile `k`
//!   starts at `S_k` and spans the largest number of screen pixels `m` with `m ≤ ⌊G / Q⌋`, for
//!   `Q` the function's maximum at the integer coordinates `S_k..=S_k + m` (a peak between two
//!   integers is not seen);
//! - the tile that reaches `W` is the last: its `e = W - S_k` screen pixels (`e < m`) map to the
//!   largest `p < min(e, G)` with `e/p` a multiple of 1/16 and `e·G ≤ m·p`, or to `min(e, G)`
//!   physical pixels where no `p` is such (`G` where `e = m`);
//! - a map of two layers has one vertical axis, compiled from the larger of the layers' vertical
//!   functions at each coordinate; each layer's horizontal axis is its own;
//! - a map of no layers has no horizontal axis (its horizontal tables are zero words) and one
//!   vertical axis, compiled from no quality function: every coordinate at the least quality.
//!
//! Outside the bounds it is measured in, [`RasterizationRateMap::new`] refuses
//! ([`RateMapError::Unpinned`], [`UnpinnedCompile`]) rather than guess: a screen extent above
//! 16384 (Apple's compile crashes or returns a corrupt map above it), more than two layers (the
//! most Apple M3 supports), more quality samples on an axis than its extent plus one, a sample
//! outside `[0, 1]` on an axis of two or more samples, and an axis of samples that are not all
//! equal past the most measured: 9 on a map of one layer, 4 on a map of two.
//!
//! [`RasterizationRateMap::from_layers`] takes explicit tiles ([`RateMapAxis`]) instead, for a
//! consumer that compiles by another rule, within what Metal's parameter data holds: tiles of 32
//! physical pixels, at most 16384 screen pixels a side, at most two layers, one vertical axis.
//!
//! **Rendering a rate-mapped pass** (`MTLRenderPassDescriptor.rasterizationRateMap`) is the
//! consumer's, on every device region by region ([`RasterizationRateMap::regions`]): into targets
//! of the map's physical size, each region drawn with the guest's viewport composed with its tiles'
//! line. The image is Metal's in structure; over a map that is not the identity its lines are this
//! crate's tiles', a near-equivalent the plan records ([`RateMapRegions::precision`]).
