//! An ETC2 or EAC texture's texels as Metal decodes them, from its blocks: the texels the decoded
//! twin of the texture holds on a device without the format (the runtime's `etc.rs`), which
//! [`etc_decode_module`] writes on the GPU.
//!
//! **The decode** is the Khronos Data Format Specification's (its ETC2 and EAC chapters), written
//! here from the specification. A block is 64 bits read most significant byte first; its texels
//! are numbered down each column (texel `(x, y)` is index `4x + y`).
//!
//! - **ETC2 RGB** ([`EtcDecode::Rgb8`]): bit 33 chooses the individual mode (two 4-bit base
//!   colors) or the differential one (a 5-bit base and a 3-bit signed delta per channel), where a
//!   red, green or blue sum outside `[0, 31]` selects the T, H or planar mode instead. A texel is
//!   its subblock's base plus the modifier its table and 2-bit index pick, a paint color of the T
//!   and H modes, or the planar mode's gradient `(x (H - O) + y (V - O) + 4 O + 2) >> 2`, each
//!   channel clamped to `[0, 255]`; alpha is 255.
//! - **ETC2 RGB8A1** ([`EtcDecode::Rgb8A1`]): bit 33 is the opaque flag and the individual mode
//!   does not exist. With the flag clear, index 2 is transparent black (all four channels 0) in the
//!   differential, T and H modes, and the differential mode's modifiers are `0, b, 0, -b`; a planar
//!   block is opaque.
//! - **EAC** (the alpha of [`EtcDecode::Rgba8`], [`EtcDecode::R11Unorm`] and the others): an
//!   8-bit base, a 4-bit multiplier `m`, one of sixteen modifier tables and a 3-bit index per
//!   texel. Alpha is `clamp(base + modifier m, 0, 255)`; an unsigned 11-bit channel is
//!   `clamp(8 base + 4 + 8 modifier m, 0, 2047)` and a signed one `clamp(8 base + 8 modifier m,
//!   -1023, 1023)`, where `m = 0` takes the modifier itself instead of `8 modifier m` and a signed
//!   base of -128 is -127. `EAC_RGBA8`'s block is the alpha block, then the RGB block; `RG11`'s is
//!   red's block, then green's.
//!
//! **Metal's answers** (an Apple M3 Max under macOS 27.0.1, our own probe: 4096 random blocks of
//! each format, every texel read as `float`, equal to this decode's in every channel): an 8-bit
//! channel reads `c / 255`, an sRGB format's color channel the step of Metal's twelve-bit table
//! (`lower::arith::srgb`, as BC1 to BC3's sRGB forms read, `metal::texel_format::srgb_raw`),
//! alpha `c / 255`; an unsigned 11-bit channel reads `c / 2047` and a signed one `c / 1023`,
//! correctly rounded to `f32` (not the 16-bit code the specification widens them to).
//!
//! **The twin's texels** ([`EtcTexels`]): `R8G8B8A8_UNORM` codes of the ETC2 formats and
//! `EAC_RGBA8` either way (an sRGB form's codes too, for a raw view decoded by Metal's table). An 11-bit format's: [`EtcTexels::Compact`] holds the 16-bit
//! normalized code nearest each value (`R16_UNORM`, `R16_SNORM` and their two-channel forms), at
//! most half a 16-bit step off it; [`EtcTexels::Float`] holds the values exactly (`R32_SFLOAT`,
//! `R32G32_SFLOAT`).
