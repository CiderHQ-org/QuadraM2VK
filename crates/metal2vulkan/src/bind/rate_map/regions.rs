//! A rate-mapped render pass drawn region by region: the option (a), on every device (the user's
//! decision of 2026-10-03: "Regions everywhere"). It is Metal's pass in structure; its lines are
//! this crate's tiles', within the bound of Apple's, so a pass over a map that is not the identity
//! is a near-equivalent ([`RateMapRegions::precision`]).
//!
//! Metal rasterizes a pass whose `MTLRenderPassDescriptor.rasterizationRateMap` is set into a
//! target of the map's physical size: inside one tile the map from screen to physical
//! coordinates is the tile's line, `P_k + (s - S_k) * (p_k / s_k)`, and a fragment is the physical
//! pixel whose center that line's inverse sends into the primitive, its attributes evaluated at
//! that screen point. The same transform is a Vulkan viewport: the guest's screen-space viewport
//! composed with a tile's line is another viewport. So the pass is drawn once per *region*, a
//! rectangle of tiles sharing one line on each axis, with that region's viewport and a scissor of
//! the region's physical pixels: every physical pixel is shaded by exactly one region, at the
//! position, with the attributes and the coverage of its tile's line.
//!
//! - Consecutive tiles of an axis whose ratios `p / s` are equal lie on one line (each starts
//!   where the previous ends), so they form one *segment*; a layer's regions are its horizontal
//!   segments times its vertical ones. A map of one quality per axis has at most two segments
//!   per axis (the last tile's ratio may differ); the worst case is one per tile.
//! - Tile boundaries are multiples of the granularity (32 physical pixels), so no 2x2 quad of
//!   physical pixels spans two regions: a derivative reads one region's line, as Metal's does.
//! - Regions are disjoint in physical pixels, so each pixel's fragments arrive in the draw's
//!   primitive order, as one draw's do: blending, depth and stencil tests, and framebuffer reads
//!   see what they see in Metal's pass.
//! - **The cost** is draws: each draw of the pass is recorded once per region
//!   ([`RateMapRegions::regions`]), so the vertex stage runs once per region. A vertex function
//!   with side effects (device writes or atomics) would repeat them:
//!   [`RateMapRegions::admits`] refuses such a pipeline in a pass of more than one region. The
//!   vertex stage's resident-set misses repeat too: the `ExecutionStatus` miss count
//!   ([`StatusReport::resident_misses`](crate::bind::StatusReport::resident_misses)) counts each
//!   once per region. Fragment invocations are Metal's: one per physical pixel a primitive
//!   covers. A plan holds at most [`RateMapRegions::MAX_REGIONS`] regions.
//! - The consumer allocates the targets at least [`RateMapRegions::physical_size`], draws with
//!   each region's viewport (Metal's convention, y down; a Vulkan consumer that flips y with a
//!   negative height uses `y + height` and `-height`) and scissor, which stands for the guest's
//!   ([`RasterizationRateMap::regions`] takes the guest's), and answers the guest's map and
//!   decoder from the same [`RasterizationRateMap`], so the image and every decoder that reads it
//!   agree with Metal's up to the lines below. The viewport's depth range is the guest's.
//! - **The lines are this crate's**. A region draws with its tiles' exact lines, where Apple's are
//!   its fixed-point ones (a scale of `K / 2^24` and an offset of 1/256 pixels), whose tile starts
//!   fall between pixels: Metal evaluates a fragment at a screen point within about 0.025 pixels of
//!   the region path's (0.0194 between the exact lines and Apple's CPU map on the measured maps,
//!   plus the 0.0052 between Metal's evaluated point and Apple's CPU map), so coverage may differ
//!   within that distance of an edge; and Metal leaves an axis's last physical line unshaded where
//!   Apple's tile end falls short of the screen's edge and the line's center lies in the last
//!   screen pixel, which happens on some axes whose last tile maps fewer than 2 screen pixels to
//!   each physical one, by Apple's private arithmetic. An axis of the identity is Apple's exactly.
//!   So [`RateMapRegions::precision`] is `PrecisionNote::RasterizationRateMap` unless both of the
//!   layer's axes are the identity, and the consumer records it for the pass.
//! - **The viewport's fractions.** Over a map that is not the identity a region's viewport bounds
//!   are fractional. A device may interpret viewport bounds at only `viewportSubPixelBits` bits of
//!   sub-pixel precision; one that rounds them to `2^-b` physical pixels moves a fragment's
//!   evaluated point by up to `2^-b` times the tile's screen pixels per physical one, on top of the
//!   bound above. MoltenVK on Apple M3 and lavapipe both report 0 bits, yet keep the fractions:
//!   the position cases `fe7630f4` and `6e087167` match Metal on both, and each would differ in at
//!   least 46 texels had the bounds been rounded to whole pixels, in any direction. Elsewhere it is
//!   not measured; the note is recorded all the same.
//!
//! [`RasterizationRateMap::regions`] refuses ([`RegionError`]) a layer the map lacks; a guest
//! viewport that is not finite, has no area, or is flipped (a negative extent); a guest scissor
//! that does not cover the screen over a map that is not the identity (where Metal applies a
//! scissor in a rate-mapped pass is not measured); a plan of more than
//! [`RateMapRegions::MAX_REGIONS`] regions; and a region whose viewport exceeds the device's
//! `maxViewportDimensions`, leaves its `viewportBoundsRange`, or has an extent that is not a
//! normal `f32`. [`RateMapRegions::admits`] refuses a layered pipeline (several map layers in one
//! pass: each layer's regions differ, which one draw cannot select), one that selects viewports
//! per primitive (the plan sets one viewport per region), and one whose vertex function writes
//! memory in a plan of several regions; [`RateMapRegions::admits_planned_layers`] admits a
//! layered pipeline whose primitives the consumer has bounded to slices this plan's layer is the
//! map's layer of (one slice, or the map's layers alike), as Metal rasterizes each primitive by
//! the map's layer of its slice.
