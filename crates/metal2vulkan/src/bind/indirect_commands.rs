//! The indirect-command record format: what a translated kernel's command encoders
//! (`compute_command`, `render_command`) write into an indirect command buffer's storage, and what
//! a CPU encoder writes, a header and one fixed-size record per command.
//!
//! A consumer that runs its own runtime on the compile layer needs it to execute and read back
//! indirect command buffers: [`CommandBuffer::initialize`] writes the header a
//! [`CommandDescriptor`] and an [`Inheritance`] fix and resets every record,
//! [`CommandRecord::encode_into`] writes one command as the CPU's encoder sets it, and
//! [`CommandBuffer::decode`] checks storage a kernel wrote (its sticky encoding fault, the header,
//! every record against the descriptor) before [`CommandBuffer::records`] reads a range back as
//! [`CommandRecord`]s. [`CommandRecord::resolve_bindings`] picks each command's pipeline and
//! buffers from itself or from the executing encoder, and [`BufferBinding::resolve_buffer`] finds
//! the [`RegisteredBuffer`] whose interval holds a buffer's address. The device replay (`replay_preprocess`)
//! reads the same records on the GPU.
