//! The synthesized stages of a tessellation pipeline.
//!
//! Metal has no tessellation control stage: a compute pass writes each patch's tessellation
//! factors to a buffer the render encoder binds (`setTessellationFactorBuffer:offset:
//! instanceStride:`), and the fixed-function tessellator reads them before the post-tessellation
//! vertex function runs once per generated vertex. Vulkan's tessellator takes its levels from a
//! tessellation control shader, so a tessellation pipeline has four stages:
//!
//! - the **vertex stage** ([`vertex_module`]) runs once per patch, each patch being the one
//!   control point of a `PATCH_LIST` patch: it writes `VertexIndex` (the patch's position, the
//!   draw's `patchStart` plus its index in the draw) and `InstanceIndex` (Metal's instance index,
//!   the base instance included) to the fixed locations
//!   `TessellationStage::PATCH_INDEX_LOCATION` and `TessellationStage::INSTANCE_LOCATION`;
//! - the **control stage** ([`control_module`]), one invocation per patch (`OutputVertices` 1),
//!   hands the evaluation stage Metal's patch index ([`patch_index`]) and the instance index as
//!   patch outputs at the same locations, and each of the patch's `N` control points' elements
//!   ([`elements`]) from `TessellationStage::CONTROL_POINT_LOCATION`, and writes the patch's
//!   tessellation levels from its factors ([`levels`]);
//! - the post-tessellation vertex function's evaluation stage, then the fragment stage.
//!
//! The control stage declares the pipeline's tessellation modes: the patch domain, the spacing
//! (Metal's `integer` and `pow2` partitions are `SpacingEqual`, `pow2` levels rounded up to a
//! power of two first; the fractional ones are Vulkan's fractional spacings), and the vertex
//! order. Under Vulkan's default upper-left domain origin, whose `TessCoord` is Metal's
//! `position_in_patch` lane for lane, Metal's clockwise output winding is `VertexOrderCcw` and its
//! counter-clockwise one `VertexOrderCw`: MoltenVK maps Vulkan's orders to Metal's windings
//! reversed (`mvkMTLWindingFromSpvExecutionMode`, with SPIRV-Cross passing `gl_TessCoord` through
//! unchanged for that origin). That is read from MoltenVK's conformant mapping, not observed on
//! Metal (an A-track reading).
//!
//! **The patch index**. Metal's patch index (`[[patch_id]]`, the element of the patch's control
//! points and per-patch attributes) is the patch's position, or, for a draw with a patch index
//! buffer, the `uint` at the position in that buffer (`patchIndexBuffer[patchStart + i]`), while
//! the factors stay at the position (Metal probes on an M4). The control stage reads that word from
//! the patch index buffer (`SyntheticBinding::PatchIndices`, bound from an aligned base below its
//! offset, a multiple of 4, as the factor buffer is) where the pushed `PatchIndexBound` is nonzero;
//! a word outside the bound range reads 0. Metal's validation stops a direct draw there; without
//! it, Metal drew patch 0 there (probes 14b, 14d).
//!
//! **Control points**. Control point `k` of the patch whose index is `p` is element `p · N + k` of
//! its `PerPatchControlPoint` vertex buffers (wrapping `u32`), or, for a pipeline with a
//! control-point index type (`tessellationControlPointIndexType` `UInt16` or `UInt32`), the index
//! at that position in the draw's control-point index buffer
//! (`SyntheticBinding::ControlPointIndices`, bound from an aligned base below its offset, a
//! multiple of the index size; the pushed `ControlPointIndexOffset` is the residual): Metal probes
//! on an M4, with and without a patch index buffer, direct and indirect. The control stage hands
//! each element to the evaluation stage, which fetches the control point's attributes there
//! (`lower::tessellation`). An index outside the bound range reads 0. Metal's validation stops a
//! direct draw whose `(patchStart + patchCount) · N` indices pass the buffer; a patch index
//! buffer's patch indices are not checked against it, and an indirect draw is not checked (probe
//! 14e).
//!
//! **Factors.** A patch's `MTLTriangleTessellationFactorsHalf` (three edge factors and an inside
//! one, 8 bytes) or `MTLQuadTessellationFactorsHalf` (four and two, 12 bytes) sits at byte
//! `offset + position · size` (per-patch step functions) `+ instance · instanceStride`
//! (per-instance ones) of the factor buffer (`MTLTessellationFactorStepFunction`). Metal's
//! validation requires the offset and the instance stride to be multiples of 4, but plain Metal
//! reads an offset of 2 at that byte (Metal probe case `factor_offset_2` on an M4), so the stage
//! reads the `half`s from an even byte: the words from the one that holds it, each holding two
//! `half`s, low half first, the first `half` that word's high one where the address is 2 past a
//! multiple of 4. The binder refuses an odd offset or stride. The descriptor binds the buffer from
//! an aligned base below the bind offset, as a buffer slot's: the address adds the pushed residual.
//! A word outside the bound range reads 0 (contained), which culls. Edge `k` is Vulkan's outer
//! level `k` and inside factor `k` its inner level `k` (Metal's edge 0 is the edge `u = 0`, 1 `v =
//! 0`, 2 `u = 1` or `w = 0`, 3 `v = 1`, as Vulkan's outer levels; SPIRV-Cross maps them lane for
//! lane too). Then, as Metal states:
//!
//! 1. an edge factor that is negative, zero, or NaN culls the patch: every outer level is written
//!    0, and Vulkan discards a patch with an outer level at or below zero;
//! 2. with `tessellationFactorScaleEnabled`, every factor is multiplied by the encoder's scale,
//!    which Metal converts to `half` first (the binder pushes it so rounded, an infinite one as
//!    2^32, which takes every positive factor past the maximum level as infinity does, and
//!    refuses one that is not a positive `half`); the product of two `half`s is exact in
//!    `float`;
//! 3. every factor is clamped to its partition's range: `[1, max]` for `pow2` and `integer`,
//!    `[1, max - 1]` for `fractionalOdd`, `[2, max]` for `fractionalEven`, `max` the descriptor's
//!    `maxTessellationFactor` (at most the device's `maxTessellationGenerationLevel`, which link
//!    checks, so Vulkan's own clamp to that level changes nothing); a NaN inside factor takes the
//!    range's lower end and an infinite one its upper end;
//! 4. `pow2` rounds a level up to the next power of two, and the stage rounds a scaled `integer`
//!    level up to an integer itself; Vulkan rounds the others as Metal does (up to an integer,
//!    an odd, or an even integer).
//!
//! **Levels at `half` precision**. A driver that hands the levels to Metal's tessellator (MoltenVK:
//! SPIRV-Cross writes them to an `MTLTriangleTessellationFactorsHalf` or
//! `MTLQuadTessellationFactorsHalf` buffer, the only factor format Metal's tessellator reads)
//! rounds each to `half` before Metal rounds it up. Every level is a `half` but a scaled one:
//! the product of two `half`s is exact in `float`, not in `half`. So the stage rounds a scaled
//! `integer` level up itself, which is exact in `half` (at most 64) and which Vulkan's own
//! rounding leaves as it is: `0x47F3` by `0x3007`, 1.000445, is level 2 on every device, where
//! MoltenVK drew one segment from the unrounded product (its `half` is 1.0;
//! `patches::scale_product_unrounded`). A `pow2` level is a power of two already. A
//! scaled fractional level stays the product, which such a driver rounds to `half` (noted with
//! the scale, `PrecisionNote::TessellationFactorScale`).
//!
//! **No float operation sees a NaN or an infinity.** Without `SignedZeroInfNanPreserve` a Vulkan
//! implementation may assume that no operand or result of a float operation is a NaN or an
//! infinity, so neither the cull nor the clamp may rest on how a float comparison treats one.
//! Each factor is classified on its `half` bits with integer operations (a culling edge factor
//! is outside `[0x0001, 0x7c00]`; a finite positive one is in `[0x0001, 0x7bff]`; `+∞` is
//! `0x7c00`); only a finite positive factor becomes a `float` (its significand converted,
//! scaled by `Ldexp` and a power of two, exact whether it is normal or subnormal: every `half`
//! is a normal `float`), and the level of any other factor is a constant, its range's lower end
//! (NaN, zero, negative) or upper end (`+∞`). The pushed scale is a positive `half` or 2^32, so
//! the scaled product lies in `[2^-48, 2^48)`: every float the stage computes is finite.
//!
//! Read from Metal's documentation but not observed, and noted on the pipeline's evaluation stage
//! ([`Control::notes`]): the output winding's vertex order; whether the fractional partitions'
//! levels take the scaled factor in `float` (Metal's `integer` levels take it unrounded, and a
//! product below `half`'s least subnormal does not cull); a subnormal edge factor and a NaN inside
//! factor under the fractional partitions (under `integer`, Metal's answer is this stage's); and
//! whether the per-instance step's instance index includes the base instance (taken to, as
//! `[[instance_id]]` does). These are A-track readings.
