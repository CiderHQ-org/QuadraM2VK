//! `RelocatableModule` serializer and `relocate`.
//!
//! [`serialize`] consumes a finalized [`TypedModule`] and writes SPIR-V 1.5 words in the logical
//! layout of the SPIR-V spec §2.4: capabilities, extensions, the `GLSL.std.450` import, the memory
//! model, the entry point, execution modes, annotations, types/constants/globals in declaration
//! order, then functions. Result ids are assigned here, densely, in that same order, so equal
//! modules serialize to equal words. An `OpCopyObject` (P9's promoted loads) is written as its
//! operand: its result takes the operand's id and the instruction is left out, which SSA dominance
//! allows (the operand dominates the copy, which dominates its uses). Every `OpUndef` of one type
//! is one module-level `OpUndef`, written after the declarations: an undefined value may be any
//! value, so one of them serves every use. A tangled value ([`Inst::is_tangled`]) that reaches a
//! lazily evaluated operand is written with its own id and an `OpCopyObject` that carries the
//! value's id (`lazy_values`), so SPIRV-Cross evaluates it where the module does, never inside a
//! `?:` arm or a `&&`/`||` operand. A value SPIRV-Cross would forward into its one reader without
//! the dependencies of its operands is written the same way (`forwards_without_dependencies`), so
//! it is evaluated where the module does, before any later write overwrites what it reads. For a
//! driver whose converter writes a composite insert into the composite it reads, or reads memory
//! again in a loop for a value loaded before it ([`serialize_for`]), an insert whose composite is
//! defined outside the innermost loop holding it reads a copy written just before it, and a value
//! read from memory that a loop not defining it reads is materialized where it is defined, so no
//! iteration reads what an earlier one wrote.
//!
//! Every number link assigns (descriptor set and binding, `Location`/`Component`, `SpecId`) is a
//! literal operand of an `OpDecorate`. The serializer writes 0 there and records a relocation
//! `(Symbol, word offset)`; [`relocate`] writes only those literals, so the words of a module with
//! its relocation slots zeroed are the same for every link.

/// Whether SPIRV-Cross forwards the result of `inst` into the instruction that reads it without

///
/// SPIRV-Cross (MoltenVK's MSL conversion) writes a value it forwards into the text of its
/// reader, so the value is evaluated where the reader is written, and it keeps that correct by
/// recording, on each forwarded expression, the expressions it is built from: a store to a
/// variable invalidates the expressions loaded from it, an `OpCompositeInsert` it performs in
/// place invalidates the composite, and a read of an expression that depends on an invalidated
/// one makes it declare the value where it stands. These forwarded results record no
/// dependencies of an operand (`adec7acb`, MoltenVK 1.4.1's pin, and upstream through
/// 2026-09-22), in `CompilerMSL`: `OpQuantizeToF16`; `OpImageQuerySizeLod`, of its level;
/// `OpUMulExtended` and `OpSMulExtended`, of either factor; `InterpolateAtSample` and
/// `InterpolateAtOffset`, of the sample or offset (the interpolant is a stage input, never
/// overwritten). In `CompilerGLSL` and `CompilerMSL` alike, no image query, sample, fetch,
/// gather, or read records the dependencies of its image or sampled image, and `OpArrayLength`
/// none of its buffer: an image, sampler, or buffer chosen from an array by an index that is not a
/// constant ([`Reads::indexed`]) is written with that index, which a later write may overwrite.
/// In `CompilerGLSL`: a call to a function SPIRV-Cross finds pure, of an argument it does not
/// load itself. Such a value read after a write that overwrites one of those operands reads the
/// new operand: authored case 29d314e8 read three half taps one step to the right on MoltenVK.

/// - A copy is its operand: a read of a copy is a read of the value whose id it takes, and the copy
///   reads nothing itself.
/// - An instruction, a phi, or a terminator reads each distinct value once, however often it names
///   it (SPIRV-Cross writes a splat of one scalar as `float4(q)`).
/// - An `OpVectorShuffle` reads an operand only when a selected component comes from it (with
///   every component from the first, SPIRV-Cross writes a swizzle of it and never reads the
///   second).
/// - Every scalar extract of one vector together is one read of the vector, made only if one of
///   them is read: SPIRV-Cross writes such an extract as a swizzle of the vector it reads where
///   the extract is read (an extract nothing reads never reads the vector), and merges adjacent
///   extracts of one vector in a constructor into one swizzle (`float4(q.xy, 0, 1)`).
/// - A switch with no case reads nothing: SPIRV-Cross writes it as a block and never reads its
///   selector. Every other terminator reads its operand: an `OpBranchConditional` the builder
///   makes (`if_`) sends its true edge to an arm block of its own, never to the merge, so
///   SPIRV-Cross always writes `if (c)`.
///
/// One forward pass in layout order (definitions before their uses, except a phi's incoming
/// values) finds each copy's root and each value that may carry an index; a second counts the
/// reads of every instruction, phi, and terminator but those extracts; a third counts the
/// extracts that are read. Counting keeps no list: a per-value mark (`Reads::SEEN`), set at an
