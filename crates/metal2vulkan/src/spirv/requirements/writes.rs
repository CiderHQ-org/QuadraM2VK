//! Whether a module writes memory of its own.
//!
//! Metal runs a multisampled fragment function that writes memory another invocation or a later
//! command can read once per covered sample, so link runs such a function under sample shading
//! (`StageInterface::writes_memory`). The writes that count are the function's: a store, a copy,
//! or an atomic other than a load into a storage buffer, a physical storage buffer, or an image,
//! and an image write.
//!
//! The product also writes one buffer the guest never names: the command buffer's
//! `ExecutionStatus` buffer, whose words the resident-miss count, an absent read's mark and a
//! `seq_cst` fence's order update. Those writes are the product's, wherever lowering places them,
//! so a write whose address derives from that buffer does not count. A stage module of a device
//! that addresses buffers reaches the buffer by the device address in the push block's
//! `ExecutionStatusAddress` member, which the placement order always puts in the push block
//! (`lower::push`'s `the_status_address_is_always_placed_in_the_push_block`); one of a device that
//! does not reaches it through its `Synthetic(ExecutionStatus)` storage buffer, the buffer's
//! binding, which counts as the buffer too. A
//! written pointer is traced back through access chains, `OpConvertUToPtr`, and an `OpIAdd` of a
//! constant; it addresses the status buffer exactly when the trace ends at that binding or at a
//! load of that member. A pointer that traces anywhere else, or not at all (a phi, a parameter, a
//! selected value), is the function's: the guest never holds the status buffer's address, so no
//! write of the guest's is taken for the product's.
//!
//! A vertex function's capture records are the product's too: they hand the draw's clip positions
//! to the tile reach kernel, and a capture variant writes memory exactly where the function does.
//! They are written at the push block's `CaptureAddress` member plus the vertex's record offset, so
//! the trace also ends at an `OpIAdd` whose one operand is a load of either address member,
//! whatever the other: the guest holds neither address, so no sum of the guest's has such an
//! operand.
//!
//! An emulated mesh function's records (`Synthetic(MeshRecords)`) are the product's too, traced as
//! the status buffer's binding is: they hand the function's outputs to the pipeline's synthesized
//! vertex stage, as a mesh function's output variables would. So is an emulated object function's
//! slot of its draw's work buffer (`Synthetic(MeshWork)`), which hands its grid and payload to the
//! mesh function, as `OpEmitMeshTasksEXT` would.
//!
//! The shader-side stencil's shadow (`Synthetic(ShadowStencil)`) is the product's too: its writes
//! carry Metal's stencil test, which Metal applies per sample whether the function runs per pixel
//! or per sample, so they do not make the function run per sample. An image write counts unless its
//! image is a load of that binding. So are the depth and stencil attachments' stand-ins
//! (`Synthetic(DepthStandIn)` and `Synthetic(StencilStandIn)`), whose writes carry Metal's depth
//! and stencil tests.
//!
//! So are a color attachment's interlocked storage form (`TileAttachment`) and an extended-range
//! color's `half` shadow (`ExtendedShadow`): their writes carry Metal's color attachment write, a
//! color output, which Metal masks as it masks any (a sample mask, a failed test) and stores per
//! sample whether the function runs per pixel or per sample, and which no other invocation or
//! command reads but through the attachment. A multisampled pipeline's storage form runs per sample
//! by its own `SampleId`. The function's other writes count as before.
