//! The full finalize verifier.
//!
//! [`verify`] runs on every finished [`TypedModule`] before it is serialized, in every build,
//! release included. The builder already makes these rules hold by construction; the verifier is
//! the always-on check that catches a builder, structurizer, or lowering bug before any bytes
//! leave the crate. A violation is an internal error
//! (`Error::Internal(Verify)`), never an input error.
//!
//! Rules, by family:
//!
//! - **Ownership.** Every block belongs to exactly one function and names it; every branch and
//!   merge target is a block of the same function; a function's first block is never a branch
//!   target.
//! - **SSA.** Every result is defined once, where its value definition says; parameters and
//!   `Function` variables belong to their function; every use is dominated by its definition
//!   (an `OpPhi` operand by the end of its incoming block); every `OpPhi` lists each predecessor
//!   exactly once and nothing else. Dominance comes from `graph`.
//! - **Structured control flow.** Constructs are the layout intervals `[header, merge)` the
//!   builder's preorder layout produces. They nest; every block follows its immediate dominator; a
//!   header dominates its construct, its merge, and its continue target; a construct is entered
//!   only through its header and left only to its merge or to the innermost loop's merge or
//!   continue target; the only backward edge is a loop's continue block to its header.
//!   `OpBranchConditional`/`OpSwitch` carry a selection merge, `OpLoopMerge` headers end in
//!   `OpBranch`; switch literals are distinct and fit the selector; case arms have the switch as
//!   their only predecessor (no fall-through); no block is the merge or continue target of two
//!   headers.
//! - **Canonical loops.** Every `OpLoopMerge` has exactly one
//!   [`LoopMeta`](crate::spirv::ir::LoopMeta) naming it, and every `LoopMeta` names one; the header
//!   is empty, entered from its preheader and its single continue block, which branches back to it.
//! - **Tangled instructions.** No tangled instruction sits inside a switch-at-use, directly or
//!   through a call.
//! - **Places.** Every atomic's pointer operand is a place: a variable, or the result of an access
//!   chain or a texel pointer. SPIRV-Cross writes an atomic's pointer as `&expr`, which MSL accepts
//!   only for a place, so an atomic on a converted device address is refused (the builder's
//!   `device_place` gives the address as a place).
//! - **Functions.** The static call graph has no cycle.
//! - **Stage rules.** `OpKill`/`OpTerminateInvocation` only in fragment modules, and only in the
//!   entry function when an interlock mode is declared; every builtin variable exists in the
//!   entry's execution model and direction.
//! - **Derived facts.** The recorded entry interface and requirements equal what the module
//!   contains (a transform that changes the module re-derives them).
//! - **Profile rules** ([`verify`] only): no `Workgroup` initializer unless the profile enables
//!   `shaderZeroInitializeWorkgroupMemory`, and the requirements are a subset of the profile
//!   (`Internal(RequirementsExceedProfile)`).
//!
//! Work is linear in the module plus, per branch edge, the number of constructs it leaves; it is
//! metered on the per-attempt [`Meter`] and every table is charged to its ledger.
