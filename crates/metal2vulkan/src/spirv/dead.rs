//! Unused pure instructions leave the emitted module, IR→IR like P9.
//!
//! The lowering computes some values that no instruction reads in the end: the exact `f32` of a
//! narrow load whose every store wrote the loaded format bits instead, a lane of a composite that a
//! later lowering rebuilt, or a partial an emulated exchange never needed. A value is *dead* when
//! nothing reads it: no instruction, phi, terminator, or tangle entry, and no dead value's reader.
//! Its instruction is removed when it is [`removable`]: it computes a result from its operands and
//! nothing else (arithmetic, conversions, composites, `GLSL.std.450`, access chains, array lengths,
//! and plain loads), so running it or not changes no other value, no memory, and no other
//! invocation. A store, atomic, barrier, image write, subgroup operation, derivative,
//! implicitly-derived sample, interpolation, volatile load, or load that makes memory visible is
//! never removed, whatever reads its result.
//!
//! A call is removed the same way when its function is pure ([`pure_functions`]): read from the
//! function's body, which has no loop, returns on every path, and holds only removable instructions
//! and calls of pure functions, so a call computes its result and nothing else. A function that no
//! call left in the module reaches from the entry point leaves after the sweep, with its body, and
//! what only it read leaves with it ([`TypedModule::remove_dead`]). No function is named: a routine
//! the lowering defines once per module (a fast division, a precise one, a `half` fused
//! multiply-add) leaves when every division that called it was dead.
//!
//! A constant nothing reads leaves too: its declaration is dropped when it is [`removable_const`]
//! and no live instruction, phi, terminator, live composite constant, or variable initializer reads
//! it, and no instruction, array type, or execution mode names it as a constant operand. Such
//! constants are what the removed instructions read, and the constants a lowering made for a
//! sequence it then did not need.
//!
//! Work is linear in the module's instructions and declarations (each value is removed at most
//! once, each removal walks its own operands, and each function's body is read once for its
//! purity and once for what it calls), metered on the per-attempt [`Meter`] with every table
//! charged to its ledger.
