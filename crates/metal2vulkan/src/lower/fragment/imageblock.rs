//! Fragment imageblocks: `[[imageblock_data]]` inputs and outputs of a fragment function.
//!
//! **What Metal gives.** A render pass keeps an imageblock in tile memory: one cell per pixel for
//! the whole pass, of the explicit layout's `air.imageblock_data_size` bytes, undefined when the
//! pass begins, and shared by every pipeline of the pass. A fragment function reads a *view* of
//! its pixel's cell as a struct parameter (`air.imageblock_data` input) and writes a view as a
//! member of its returned struct (`air.imageblock_data` output). A view's members name members of
//! the *master* layout (`air.imageblock_master`; the view's own layout when it has none) by their
//! user key, the fifth string of each member tuple (`Member::key`; MSL §4.7.1: `[[user(name)]]`,
//! else the declared name, "must match a data member declared in the master"), and each member
//! lives at its master offset. The master's fingerprint (SHA-256 of its data size and its
//! layout's Merkle digest over each member's offset, size, array length, key, and nested
//! layout's digest, each shared layout hashed once) is the fact's and
//! `FragmentImageblock::master`: a consumer draws only pipelines of one master in a pass.
//! Explicit imageblock layouts cannot alias color attachments (no `[[color(n)]]` member, MSL
//! §4.7), and in a fragment function every master member names a raster order group, which
//! orders the accesses of overlapping fragments in primitive order.
//!
//! **The representation** (`ImageblockMechanism::StorageImageInterlock`). The pass's imageblock
//! is one coherent `R32Uint` 2D-array storage image, `SyntheticBinding::Imageblock`: layer `w`
//! holds word `w` of every pixel's cell, the cell of pixel `(x, y)` at texel `(x, y)`, which the
//! function takes from `FragCoord`. The input view is read once, member by member, in the
//! function's first block ([`emit_entry`]); the output view is written member by member at the
//! return ([`emit_return`]), each member a leaf of the cell's words (`memory::leaf`, a sub-word
//! member replaces only its bytes). The whole body runs inside the ordered pixel-interlock critical
//! section (`fragment::rog`), so the read, the body, and the write of each fragment are one step in
//! primitive order against every other fragment of the pixel, across draws, and its accesses'
//! device-scope coherence (the `Coherent` image under `GLSL450`, `MakeTexel*` under the Vulkan
//! model: `sync::memory_model`) makes each critical section's writes visible to the next one. That
//! is Metal's raster order group ordering, and more (groups only relax it).
//!
//! A discarded fragment writes nothing: a demoted invocation's image writes have no effect, a
//! terminate-form discard returns before the write, and a predicated one skips the write
//! (`discarded`). Nor does a fragment whose returned `[[sample_mask]]` does not cover its one
//! sample (bit 0 clear; the mask's other bits do not keep it): Metal drops the fragment and its
//! imageblock write with it (measured on the M3 Max and an M4), so the write is guarded by the
//! returned mask's bit 0 ([`ImageblockPlan::mask`]).
//!
//! **Two masters.** The input and output views may view different masters: each view's members
//! live at its own master's offsets of the one cell, which spans the largest master (measured on
//! the M3 Max and an M4, a `half` read at byte 0 of one master and written through a smaller master
//! that keys it at byte 2, and back, each reached those bytes and kept the rest). The fact's master
//! is the largest's.
//!
//! **Refused.** A profile without `fragmentShaderPixelInterlock` is
//! `Unsupported{Imageblocks, Feature(FragmentShaderPixelInterlock)}`; an output without
//! `fragmentStoresAndAtomics` names that feature. Not implemented: a second input or output view,
//! an output aliasing the implicit imageblock (`air.alias_implicit_imageblock`: it is the color
//! attachments' storage; an aliased input never reaches this family, `select::param_family`
//! refuses it as `TileShading`), a member that is an array or a struct, names a color
//! attachment, or whose value is wider than its slot, a view member without exactly one master
//! member of its size, a view struct field no member covers, and a view without a data size.
//! Link refuses what the one plane does not
//! model (multisampling, and a write that alpha to coverage, or a late depth or stencil test, can
//! drop: `pipeline::link::imageblock`), and the binder a layered or amplified pass. A packed
//! pixel-format member (`_pixel_type`) is refused before this family plans it, by its conversion
//! (`Lowering(Arith)` or `UnknownIntrinsic`).
