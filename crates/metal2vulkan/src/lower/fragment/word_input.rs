//! Metal's write of some of a word attachment's channels on a device that orders framebuffer fetch
//! through rasterization-order input attachments.
//!
//! An attachment the device renders through a view of its word (`metal::format::WordAttachment`)
//! has one component, which the device writes whole, so the device's write mask cannot keep a
//! field of it. On a device that orders fetch through the pixel interlock the storage form merges
//! the word (`fetch`); on one that orders it through input attachments with rasterization-order
//! access (lavapipe) the function reads the texel's word through the attachment's input attachment
//! at its first output's write (at the invocation's sample in a multisampled pipeline) and stores
//! Metal's word of the output (`stage_io::word_color::encode`) with the fields of the channels the
//! descriptor's write mask leaves out taken from the word read, as Metal's tile keeps them. Link
//! writes the whole word (`RuntimeFact::WordInputMerge`). Rasterization-order attachment access
//! orders each fragment's read after every earlier fragment's write of the pixel, so each merge
//! keeps what the fragments before it stored.
//!
//! The function compiles under the descriptor's mask (`LoweringInputs::framebuffer_fetch`), which
//! is the descriptor's own for the formats this merges, the 8-bit sRGB words
//! (`color_writes::merged_word`); a stage linked into a pipeline of another mask there was
//! compiled for another pipeline, `NeedsInput(FramebufferFetch)` (`link::fetch::word_merges`).
