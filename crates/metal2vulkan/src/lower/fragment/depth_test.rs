//! A fragment function that runs its draw's depth test itself, inside the ordered pixel
//! interlock, against a stand-in of the depth attachment.
//!
//! **Where.** A function that writes a color through the interlocked storage form stores inside the
//! shader, before Vulkan's tests. Where its draws' tests may drop a fragment and it cannot declare
//! early tests (`RuntimeFact::TestedStorageWrites`: it discards under tests that write, writes
//! other memory, or runs on a driver that drops an early-tests shader's image writes at more than
//! one sample), a store before the tests keeps colors Metal's tests drop. Compiled for a draw whose
//! depth test alone can drop a fragment (`LoweringInputs::shader_tests`, the binder's
//! `FragmentTests::Depth`), the function runs that test at its return instead, next to its color
//! store, as Metal tests after the function:
//!
//! - the consumer keeps the depth attachment in the subpass under `Always` without writes, and
//!   holds its depth in a stand-in (`GraphicsState::shader_tests`, `SyntheticBinding::DepthStandIn`):
//!   an `R32_SFLOAT` storage image of the pass's size, texel `(x, y)` for pixel `(x, y)`, copied
//!   from the attachment before the draws and back after them;
//! - at each return, unless a discard was recorded, the function takes the fragment's depth,
//!   clamps it as Metal does by the draw's depth clip mode (to `[0, 1]` in clip mode, to the
//!   viewport's range `[min(near, far), max(near, far)]` in clamp mode; a `-0` as `+0`), compares
//!   it with the stand-in's texel by the draw's compare function, writes it there where it passes
//!   and the draw writes depth, and records a failing fragment as discarded, so the storage form's
//!   color store skips it and the entry kills it after the critical section;
//! - the draw's depth state is `PushField::ShaderTestsState` (see its docs).
//!
//! The ordered interlock makes each fragment's test, depth write and color store one step in
//! primitive order across the draws of a subpass, so the next fragment tests against the depth
//! the last one left: Metal's order. The body runs whole, every memory write included, for every
//! fragment, as Metal runs it before its tests.
//!
//! **The fragment's depth**. At one sample it is `FragCoord.z`: the device's own depth, which its
//! fixed-function test compares, with the draw's depth bias, at the pixel's one sample (on the M4,
//! Metal's `[[position]].z`, equal bit for bit to the depth Metal tests once clamped; on ANV, RADV
//! and NVIDIA the depth the device's own draw stores).
//!
//! **More than one sample.** The function runs once per covered sample (its `SampleId`) and tests
//! its sample of a stand-in holding each: a multisampled storage image, or, on a device without
//! one, sample planes (a 2D array, layer `s` for sample `s`). A device whose `FragCoord.z` there is
//! its sample's, the depth its own test stores at that sample (RADV, measured,
//! `VkProperty::SampleFragCoordDepth`), tests `FragCoord.z` as at one sample. A device whose
//! `FragCoord.z` is the pixel centre's there while each sample stores its own (MoltenVK, measured,
//! `VkProperty::CenterFragCoordDepth`) has the function compute each sample's depth: its vertex
//! function writes the position's window depth `z / w` to a no-perspective varying
//! (`IoRole::WindowDepth`, `LoweringInputs::window_depth_varying`), and the function takes
//! `v(sample) · (far − near) + near`, plus `FragCoord.z` less `v(centre) · (far − near) + near`,
//! which carries the draw's depth bias, each operation rounded on its own: `v(sample)` read through
//! `InterpolateAtSample` at the invocation's sample, `v(centre)` read as it is, which that device
//! reads at the pixel centre. On the M4 that is the depth MoltenVK stores at each sample in the
//! flat, sloped and steep cases, under a constant bias, and where the clamp decides; under
//! perspective, a slope-scaled bias, or a viewport range other than `[0, 1]` it is within 2 ulp.
//! The module records `PrecisionNote::ComputedSampleDepth`, which no draw's
//! state can rule out at compile time. Another device is refused at more than one sample.
//!
//! **A returned depth**. A function that returns `[[depth(...)]]` tests the depth it returns at
//! that return, in place of `FragCoord.z`, as Metal tests it: a positive NaN fails the test,
//! `Always` included, which the return's store of the depth output records as discarded before the
//! test (`stage_io::clamp_depth`); any other value with its sign bit set is +0 (a negative NaN
//! stays 0 in clamp mode, past the range); a value past 1 is 1; then, in clamp mode, the viewport's
//! range clamps it. It takes no depth bias, and is the same at every sample, so it needs neither of
//! the per-sample depth sources above.
//!
//! **The stencil test**. Compiled for a draw whose stencil test can drop a fragment or write too
//! (`LoweringInputs::shader_stencil`, the binder's `FragmentTests::Stencil`, in a pass with a depth
//! and a stencil attachment), the function runs it first, as Metal does, against a stand-in of the
//! stencil (`SyntheticBinding::StencilStandIn`): an `R8_UINT` storage image of the pass's size,
//! texel `(x, y)` for pixel `(x, y)`, each sample at more than one (multisampled; sample planes are
//! not implemented). At each return, unless a discard was recorded, the face's state (`FrontFacing`
//! selects the front or back word and reference of `PushField::ShaderStencilState`) compares the
//! reference with the stand-in's value under the read mask; the face's stencil-failure operation
//! applies where that fails, its depth-failure operation where the depth test fails, and its pass
//! operation where both pass, under the write mask, as `s' = (s & !mask) | (op(s, r) & mask)` with
//! Metal's clamps and wraps (measured: Vulkan's rule); and only a fragment that passes both tests
//! writes its depth and stores its colors. The stand-in's read, operation and write are one step of
//! the critical section, as the depth's are.
//!
//! **A returned stencil and sample mask**. A function that returns `[[stencil]]` tests with the
//! output's low 8 bits as both faces' reference, in place of the draw's (measured), its stencil
//! output stored nowhere else: the device's stencil test is off for such draws (`stage_io`), and
//! where their stencil test does nothing the output changes nothing. A function that returns
//! `[[sample_mask]]` keeps a fragment only where the mask holds the invocation's sample's bit (bit
//! 0 at one sample; a per-sample invocation's other bits do nothing): at each return, before the
//! tests, a fragment without it is recorded as discarded, so it runs no test, writes neither
//! stand-in, and stores no color, as Metal drops the samples outside the mask (measured on an M4).
//! Beside a returned stencil Metal still runs the stencil test for such a sample, with the returned
//! reference, and fails its depth test whatever the draw's compare function: the stencil-failure
//! operation where the stencil test fails, else the depth-failure operation, no depth write and no
//! color. So does the function, where it runs the stencil test.
