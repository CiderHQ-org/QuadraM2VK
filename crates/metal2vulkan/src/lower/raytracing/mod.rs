//! Ray intersection through `VK_KHR_ray_query`.
//!
//! An acceleration-structure argument (`primitive_acceleration_structure`,
//! `instance_acceleration_structure`) at `[[buffer(n)]]` is an `OpTypeAccelerationStructureKHR`
//! descriptor bound at that slot (`ResourceKind::AccelerationStructure`); the binder binds a
//! top-level structure there, wrapping a primitive-level one in one identity instance.
//!
//! An `air.intersect` call ([`Intersect`]) is one complete traversal: a ray query initialized
//! with the ray and the flags the intersector's settings select, `OpRayQueryProceedKHR` until
//! traversal completes, committing the triangle candidates its intersection function table
//! accepts, and the committed intersection read into the result's fields (`emit`). The call's
//! value is a record of the result's fields without its primitive-data pointer
//! ([`result_repr`]); each `extractvalue` of it is a [`RayTracingStrategy::Field`].
//! `air.get_null_intersection_function_table` has no value: its only readers are intersect
//! calls, which read it as "no intersection functions".
//!
//! The primitive-data pointer points into the acceleration structure, at data Metal copied there
//! from the geometry's primitive-data buffer; no Vulkan structure holds such data. Memory gives it
//! the call's opaque root ([`primitive_data_root`]), and this family owns it: its `extractvalue`,
//! from the result or from an aggregate it was inserted into, has no value
//! ([`RayTracingStrategy::PrimitiveData`]). It may be moved (inserted into an aggregate,
//! extracted again, carried as a member of a member-wise phi, which holds zeros for it) and stored
//! into thread memory whose stored bytes nothing reads ([`plan_unread_stores`]): such a store
//! writes nothing ([`RayTracingStrategy::UnreadStore`]). Every other reader (a load or store
//! through it, a compare, a conversion, a merge, any other store) reads the data or its address,
//! and is refused ([`primitive_data_reader`]).
//!
//! [`primitive_data_root`]: crate::memory::provenance::primitive_data_root
//!
//! A multi-level intersector (`intersector<instancing, max_levels<n>>`) traverses a Vulkan
//! top-level structure, which holds one level of instances: the binder refuses a Metal instance
//! of an instance structure (`bind::acceleration`). So a hit traversed exactly one instance: its
//! `instance_count` is 1, and the call writes that instance's id and user id into the first
//! element of the instance-id and user-instance-id arrays it is given ([`LevelIds`]); a miss's
//! count is 0, with every other field, and it writes neither.
//!
//! **The instance count**. `air.get_instance_count_instance_acceleration_structure`
//! (`get_instance_count()`) of an entry argument's instance structure reads the push field
//! `PushField::InstanceCount` of its slot (`RuntimeFact::AccelerationStructureInstanceCount`):
//! no Vulkan instruction reads a structure's instance count, and the consumer that holds the
//! Metal structure knows it, so the binder writes it (`StageTable::acceleration_structures`, 0
//! for an unbound slot). A structure argument whose every reader is such a query needs no
//! descriptor, so no ray tracing feature: its count is exact on every device wherever the
//! consumer knows the count when it records the command (`bind::BoundAccelerationStructure`).
//! The other queries of a structure (its instances' primitive structures, its instance
//! descriptors) stay refused.
//!
//! An `intersection_function_table` argument at `[[buffer(n)]]` is a read-only buffer of `u32`
//! words at that slot, the layout of a visible-function table (`pipeline::table`): word 0 marks a
//! bound table, word 1 is its size, and word `2 + i` entry `i`, which is `0` for an entry never set
//! and `1` (`FunctionHandle::RESERVED_WORD`) for Metal's opaque triangle intersection function
//! (`setOpaqueTriangleIntersectionFunctionWithSignature:`). Its only readers are intersect calls.
//! The candidate's entry is the one at its instance's shader-binding-table record offset, where the
//! binder carries Metal's table offset (`bind::acceleration`). An intersection function the
//! pipeline links would be a case of the entry's switch; linking one is not implemented, so an
//! intersect call through a table of a stage that may link one is refused
//! ([`Entry::intersection_candidates`]).
//!
//! [`Entry::intersection_candidates`]: crate::air::canon::Entry::intersection_candidates
//!
//! Every lowered intersect call records `PrecisionNote::DeviceRayIntersection`: the device
//! computes the hit, and the conventions no Metal reading has settled yet are this lowering's.
//!
//! Refused, each a typed `Unsupported`: an intersect call through an intersection function table
//! of a stage that may link an intersection function, through a table that is not one entry
//! argument, or through an intersection function buffer, and a table argument read otherwise
//! (a `set_buffer`, refused at that reader) (`IntersectionFunctionTable`); motion
//! (`NotRepresentable`: a ray query has no time, which decides before the rest of the call);
//! curves; a structure that is not an entry argument (an argument-buffer member) or an array of
//! them; a result used other than by `extractvalue`, or its primitive-data pointer read; and a
//! profile without `rayQuery`, `accelerationStructure`, and `bufferDeviceAddress`. A multi-level
//! intersector whose `max_levels` is computed, or a constant outside the 2 to 32 Metal's compiler
//! accepts, is not Metal's (`InvalidInput`). An instance count of a structure that is not an entry
//! argument is refused (`NotImplemented`); the count itself needs no device feature.
