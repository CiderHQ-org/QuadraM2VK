//! Aggregates that hold pointers: `insertvalue` and `extractvalue` on a struct or array with a
//! pointer member, such as the `struct { texture2d<T> t; sampler s; }` that MSL passes by value
//! (`insertvalue %struct.TextureFetcher poison, ptr addrspace(1) %tex, 0, 0`).
//!
//! Such an aggregate is **never a SPIR-V value**. A pointer's lowered representation belongs to
//! the pointer's family and depends on its provenance, not on its type (a texture handle index, a
//! buffer root and offset, ...), so no one SPIR-V type holds the aggregate. Instead the memory
//! analysis resolves every pointer an `extractvalue` reads through the `insertvalue` chain that
//! built its aggregate (`memory::provenance`), and the families use the resolved roots:
//!
//! - an `insertvalue` whose result holds a pointer, and an `extractvalue` whose result is such an
//!   aggregate, emit nothing and define no value ([`ArithStrategy::PointerAggregate`]);
//! - an `extractvalue` of a texture or sampler handle with one static candidate is that
//!   candidate's constant handle index ([`ArithStrategy::Handle`]); a texture or sampler
//!   operation on it binds the candidate directly, as it would the parameter;
//! - an `extractvalue` of a pointer member that a null (device or constant) or undefined pointer
//!   constant supplies, or that an insertion chain's undefined (or null) base supplies because no
//!   insertion does, is the null pointer in the result's own representation
//!   ([`ArithStrategy::Null`]), as such a member of a member-wise phi is (below): the null fat
//!   pointer, the null handle index, or an arena offset of 0 for an undefined one;
//! - any other `extractvalue` whose member one `insertvalue` of the chain supplies wholly (a heap
//!   handle loaded from an argument buffer, a handle with several candidates, a buffer, arena,
//!   or buffer-table pointer, a non-pointer member) is that inserted value itself
//!   ([`ArithStrategy::Forward`]), in the representation its own family gave it. The value is
//!   read where the `extractvalue` stands, so it is carried there like any operand
//!   ([`forwarded`], which `select` and `emit` consult for the block-crossing values). A pointer's
//!   value is its provenance's encoding (a root and offset, an arena or table offset, a handle
//!   index), which provenance gives the extraction from its one source (`memory::provenance`
//!   joins the sources of a pointer-typed `extractvalue`), so a forwarded pointer and its source
//!   have one [`Repr`] by construction; the forward checks it.
//!
//! **Member-wise phis**. A `phi` of such an aggregate (MPS's `_MPSKernelInOut` rebuilt in two
//! branches and merged) is the one exception: it is a SPIR-V composite of its members'
//! representations ([`phi_type`]), a pointer member's the one every value that can reach it has
//! (through insertion chains and other member-wise phis; a null or undefined pointer takes any),
//! every other member the arith family's. On each edge the copy into the phi assembles its
//! incoming aggregate member by member from the values its insertion chain inserted
//! ([`incoming`], [`Build`]), and an `extractvalue` whose member comes from the phi is a
//! composite extract of the phi's value ([`ArithStrategy::Member`]). A pointer member is to the
//! phi what an incoming pointer is to a pointer phi: provenance joins every value that can reach
//! it into each extraction of it (`memory::provenance` resolves extractions through phis), so the
//! extraction's representation is the member's and each value's encoding reads back under it.
//!
//! Every other use of such an aggregate (a `select`, `freeze`, store, or return of it) is refused
//! by its own family, which finds no lowered representation for it. Not implemented
//! (`Unsupported{Lowering(Arith), NotImplemented}`): an `extractvalue` that no one insertion or
//! member-wise phi supplies wholly (from a `select`, load, or parameter aggregate, or a member an
//! inner insertion overwrites in part), one of a handle of a family other than textures and
//! samplers, which that family lowers, and a member-wise phi whose pointer member two reaching
//! values give different representations, or whose incoming aggregate has a member no value
//! supplies in the member's representation.
