//! GPU-encoded indirect commands: an encoder's operations write the host's command records
//! (`HostRecordsV1`, `crate::indirect_commands`) through device addresses.
//!
//! **Object words.** An argument buffer's command-buffer or pipeline-state member is an
//! indirect-command object. Its handle load (`memory::provenance::object_handle_load`) reads the
//! member's field, 8 bytes, as data ([`EncodeStrategy::Word`], a `u64`): a command buffer's word is
//! its resource ID, Metal's `gpuResourceID`, whose records lie at the guest address
//! `indirect_commands::records_address` of it, `2^63 + id * 2^40`; a pipeline state's word is the
//! template's host-registered token. A handle load is admitted only when every use of its value is
//! an encoder operand of its class ([`plan_objects`]): the command operand of an encoder operation,
//! or the pipeline operand of `air.set_pipeline_state_{compute,render}_command`. Any other use (an
//! integer, a compare, a store, a merge) leaves the load refused as before
//! (`ArgumentBufferObjects`, `pointer::select`), so no other instruction observes the word.
//!
//! **Operations** ([`EncodeStrategy::Command`]). The command word's records address is searched
//! in the resident set (`dynamic::search`), and the record buffer is accessed through its root
//! entry, contained: an access through root 0 (an address no resident allocation holds) is counted
//! under isolation and lands in the sink. Each operation reads the header's capacity, policy bits,
//! and binding counts; when the write is valid by the descriptor policy
//! (`indirect_commands::Policy`) it writes the command's fields, and otherwise it sets the header's
//! sticky fault flag (a relaxed atomic store of 1) and writes nothing, exactly as the old engine's
//! helpers do (`CommandEncoderOperation::helper`), so the host's `CommandBuffer::decode` fails the
//! run. A buffer setter writes its buffer's guest address (the pointer escapes, so it is wide) and,
//! for a kernel or vertex buffer, its attribute stride (a fragment, object or mesh buffer has
//! none; AIR 2.5's kernel or vertex setter takes none and writes the pipeline's own, all ones, as
//! the stride today's compiler spells MSL's plain setter with); a pipeline setter the pipeline
//! state's word; a dispatch its grid, local size, and action;
//! a draw its five arguments and action (on a buffer of mesh draws alone, nothing and no fault, as
//! a kernel's draw there draws nothing on Metal: `Policy::dropped_on`); a mesh draw its grid, its
//! object and mesh threadgroups' threads, and its action; an indexed draw its five arguments, its
//! index type (the overload's), its index buffer's guest address (wide, as a buffer setter's), and
//! its action; a patch draw its six arguments, its patch index and factor buffers' guest addresses
//! (0 for a null patch index buffer), its factor scale's `f32` bits, and its action; an indexed
//! patch draw a patch draw's fields and its control-point index buffer's guest address (0 for null)
//! where the record keeps it, under its own action; a barrier (of a compute or a render command)
//! its flag (set or cleared); a threadgroup-length setter the length at its binding, as set (a
//! multiple of 16 or not, as Metal keeps it); a stage-in region setter its six words; an imageblock
//! size setter its two `u16`s; and a reset (of a compute or render command) the whole record as
//! `CommandRecord::default` encodes it, in a loop of `u64` stores.
//!
//! **Copies** (`copy_command`). The source command buffer is an object word too, and its record
//! buffer is searched as the command's is. A copy is valid when the source index is below the
//! source's capacity and the two headers are of equal descriptors (policy bits and binding counts),
//! in which case it copies the whole record, `u64` by `u64` in a loop; or when the destination
//! inherits its pipeline and its buffers from a source that inherits neither and is otherwise of
//! the same descriptor (the destination binds no kernel buffer), in which case it copies every
//! `u64` but the pipeline's and the buffer bindings', the state the destination takes from the
//! encoder that executes it, as Metal's copy measured (M3 and M4). Any other copy's result depends
//! on Metal's private record layout (a copy between other descriptors, an index at either
//! capacity): it sets the destination's sticky fault and copies nothing.
//!
//! **Profile F** has no device addresses: every operation is `GpuEncodedIndirectCommands`, naming
//! what it lacks of `bufferDeviceAddress` and `shaderInt64`. A vertex or fragment function on a
//! device without the stage's store feature refuses an operation the same way, naming the
//! feature.
