//! A fragment function's threadgroup memory: its tile's, which Metal keeps for the tile across the
//! render pass, as it keeps a tile function's.
//!
//! **What Metal gives** (measured on an M4, and on an M4 and an M3 Max):
//!
//! - A fragment function's `[[threadgroup(n)]]` argument is its tile's threadgroup memory: the
//!   allocation the pass's tile functions' arguments reach, placed where
//!   `setThreadgroupMemoryLength:offset:atIndex:` placed argument `n`. A tile dispatch reads what
//!   the draws before it wrote there, and the draws after it read what it wrote.
//! - Every fragment of the tile shares it: a relaxed atomic add from each fragment of a draw over
//!   a 16x16 tile counts 256.
//! - It starts at zero with each pass.
//! - Draws see each other's writes in encode order: two draws whose fragments each store their
//!   own value to one word leave the later draw's.
//! - In a multisampled pass the function runs once per covered sample: at 2 samples, a tile of
//!   256 covered pixels counts 512, as at 4 samples it counts 1024.
//! - Metal's compiler refuses a `threadgroup` variable in a fragment function ("variables in the
//!   threadgroup address space cannot be declared in a fragment function"), so the function's
//!   threadgroup memory is its arguments alone; one that declares any is
//!   `InvalidDescriptor(TileThreadgroupVariable)`, as a tile function that does.
//!
//! **What runs.** The function's threadgroup arena is its tile's words in the pass's buffer of
//! every tile's memory (`SyntheticBinding::TileMemory`, the buffer a tile function's entry stages
//! from and back to; `memory::arena`): tile `t = (y / h) · TileGridWidth + x / w`, `(x, y)` the
//! integer part of the fragment's `FragCoord` (its pixel) and `w x h` the pass's tile
//! (`SpecKey::ImageblockWidth`, `SpecKey::ImageblockHeight`), whose word 0 is the buffer's word
//! `t · TileThreadgroupLength / 4` ([`base`], computed once in the function's first block). Each
//! argument is a region of the arena at its `SpecKey::TgOffset`, as a tile function's, and every
//! access is the arena's: contained against `TileThreadgroupLength`, its sub-word stores and its
//! atomics `Device`-scope word atomics of the buffer, ordering it as device memory. A write of it
//! (a store, or any atomic) needs `fragmentStoresAndAtomics`. A function that writes it writes
//! memory (`StageInterface::writes_memory`), so in a multisampled pipeline link runs it once per
//! covered sample under the pipeline's sample shading, as Metal runs it (it needs
//! `sampleRateShading`, and one compiled without `multisampled` is `NeedsInput(Multisampled)`, as
//! it reads `FragCoord`); one that only reads it runs once per pixel, reading what each of the
//! pixel's samples would.
//!
//! **Order.** The fragments of one draw reach the memory as Metal's do, unordered but for their
//! atomics. The render encoder orders draws that reach it in encode order across render pass
//! instances (`runtime::render`), as Vulkan orders no storage write of one draw before another's
//! read inside an instance but pixel by pixel.
