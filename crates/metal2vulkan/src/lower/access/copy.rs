//! `llvm.memcpy`, `llvm.memmove`, and `llvm.memset`.
//!
//! **Endpoints.** Each pointer operand is resolved like a plain access's: static-root buffer slots
//! (descriptor views or device addresses; several candidates dispatched by a switch-at-use per
//! leaf; a source's candidates may include the constant blob), a wide (dynamic-root) pointer's
//! allocation (its root entry read once, each unit contained against it), the threadgroup or
//! private arena, or the constant blob (a source only). A typed object never reaches a memory
//! intrinsic: an alloca or constant global with one is placed in the private arena or the blob by
//! construction, so meeting one is an internal invariant failure.
//!
//! **Leaves.** The length is split into units of the widest leaf both endpoints' alignments
//! allow: 4-byte words when both are word-aligned, else single bytes; a word copy's last
//! `len mod 4` bytes are byte leaves. An endpoint is word-aligned when its call-site `align` is at
//! least 4, or when it is an arena or blob pointer whose offset is a translation-time constant
//! multiple of 4 (an object's placed offset displaced by constant GEPs; both memories start at a
//! word). A `memcpy` or `memmove` of a constant multiple of 16 bytes with a static buffer endpoint,
//! every buffer endpoint's call-site `align` at least 16 and every other endpoint word-aligned,
//! moves 16-byte `uvec4` units instead: a buffer slot with a `uvec4` view moves each unit as one
//! element of it, and every other memory as its four words. Every unit is one leaf load and store
//! (`memory::leaf`), each contained exactly as a plain access of that leaf, so a byte store never
//! disturbs a neighbour (the sub-word atomics); an arena unit at a constant offset that ends inside
//! the arena's translation-time size has no check, which could only pass. `memset` stores the byte
//! pattern (`byte · 0x01010101` for a word).
//!
//! **Loops.** Up to [`UNROLL_UNITS`] units of a constant length are unrolled, a 16-byte unit
//! counting as the four words it moves ([`unroll_units`]). A longer copy or fill is a counted loop
//! over the units, whose trip count is a translation-time constant (statically bounded; it opens a
//! builder loop), followed by the unrolled tail. A length that is not a constant (the dynamic size)
//! is a counted loop over `len / unit` units, followed by the tail bytes, each under `if (b < len
//! mod 4)`. No assumption is made about an `i64` length's high word: between wide endpoints only (a
//! `memcpy` or `memmove` whose both endpoints are wide, or a wide `memset`), whose allocations'
//! root entries have `u64` sizes, a `u64` length is counted exactly, with a `u64` counter and
//! displacements. Every other endpoint is displaced in `u32` (static slots, arenas, the blob: the
//! offset space), so a length of 2³² or more reaches past every byte it can address: the call is
//! out of bounds, and it counts as `u32::MAX` bytes, each unit contained. That covers every `i64`
//! held as two words without `shaderInt64`: such a profile has no device addresses
//! (`BufferAccess::Floor`), so no wide endpoint, and every window is at most
//! `maxStorageBufferRange` bytes.
//!
//! **Overlap.** `memcpy` operands may not overlap (LLVM). A `memmove` of at most
//! [`UNROLL_UNITS`] constant units loads every unit before storing any, so overlap is exact. A
//! longer or dynamic `memmove` ([`Overlap`]) between different memories (a buffer and an arena or
//! the blob, or the two arenas) cannot overlap and copies forward; within one arena, or within one
//! buffer slot (both endpoints' only candidate), it compares the two offsets from the memory's
//! start and copies forward when the destination is not above the source and backward otherwise,
//! which is exact for any overlap. Buffer endpoints with different or several candidate slots may
//! alias through the binding (one buffer bound at two slots), and a wide endpoint may reach any
//! buffer: those compare the endpoints' Metal addresses instead (`Overlap::Addressed`; a static
//! candidate's is its `SlotGuestBase` plus its displacement, a wide pointer's its root entry's
//! `guest + bind_offset + offset`), which needs `shaderInt64` for the `u64` addresses
//! (`Unsupported{PointerCompare}` naming it otherwise).
//!
//! **Volatile** intrinsics lower as the others, every unit accessed exactly once and in order, with
//! every word load and store of a unit carrying `Volatile` (a volatile load or store's operand; the
//! read-only blob stays plain). `volatile` orders nothing between invocations (only atomics,
//! barriers, and coherent accesses order memory across them).
