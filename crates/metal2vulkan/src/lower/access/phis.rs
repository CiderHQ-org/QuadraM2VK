//! What a pointer phi's incoming values are, read once per phi.
//!
//! A pointer phi's lowered representation refuses some incoming values, and each family that owns
//! a representation asks about its own: a static fat pointer refuses a constant other than null
//! and a blob pointer (`access::lowered_pointer`), a wide pointer anything neither null nor wide
//! (`dynamic::lowered_pointer`), and a handle, an arena or typed-object offset, and a blob offset
//! any constant (`handle`, `local`, `blob`). Every read of the phi's representation (each
//! operand, each block-crossing use) asked again, a walk of the incoming values per read, which
//! was quadratic in a function whose many uses read a phi of many incoming values. Each answer is a
//! function of the body, the memory plan, and the root sets selection read before any instruction
//! (`root_sets`), so [`plan`] reads every pointer phi's incoming values once, before any
//! instruction is selected: one work unit per phi and per incoming value, the table charged while
//! selection runs.
