//! Reads of an argument the pipeline's function constants removed.
//!
//! Specialization makes each observed read of a texture argument the constants removed (a read,
//! sample, gather, query, or atomic), or each sample through a removed sampler argument,
//! [`FunctionConstant::AbsentRead`] (`air::canon::interface`). Metal gives such a read no value:
//! its compiler dropped a store of one, made a fragment color computed from one all-zero, and,
//! beside a removed texture table, dropped a kernel's whole body, so no one translation is Metal's.
//! Where the read runs, the function sets `StatusBits::ABSENT_ARGUMENT_READ` in the command
//! buffer's `ExecutionStatus` word (a relaxed device-scope `OR`, as the resident-set miss counter
//! writes it) and takes zero for the read's result; a consumer that reads the bit reports the
//! command buffer's execution as failed, so that zero reaches no result reported as good. The write
//! is on the read's path only: a run that never reaches the read is Metal's exactly, and a module
//! without one is unchanged.
//!
//! A load or atomic of threadgroup memory the constants removed is the same read
//! ([`FunctionConstant::AbsentMemory`]), and so is a texture operation on a removed texture or
//! sampler that lowering reaches through memory, an aggregate, a table, or a merge
//! (`texture::AbsentArgument`), which shares [`require`] and [`mark`].
//!
//! The stage states [`RuntimeFact::AbsentArgumentRead`] and [`RuntimeFact::ExecutionStatus`]. It
//! reaches the buffer by its device address ([`PushField::ExecutionStatusAddress`]) where the
//! device addresses buffers (`bufferDeviceAddress` and `shaderInt64`), and through a storage-buffer
//! binding of its own (`SyntheticBinding::ExecutionStatus`, [`StatusBinding`]) where it does not,
//! one more storage descriptor of the stage: a stage past a per-stage limit with it is refused as
//! `DescriptorCount` (`lower::select`), naming the limit. A vertex or fragment function needs its
//! stage's stores and atomics; a device without them refuses the read as
//! `FunctionConstantArgument`, naming what it needs.
