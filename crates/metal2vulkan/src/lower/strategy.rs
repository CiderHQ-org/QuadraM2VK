//! `Strategy`: the closed enum of per-family strategy enums.
//!
//! One variant per lowering family that instructions route to, each wrapping that family's own
//! enum, defined in the family module. A family whose lowering has not landed has an empty
//! (uninhabited) enum: its `select` refuses, so no plan ever holds one, and every match over it
//! is total by construction. Each variant of a family enum has exactly one emit function (the
//! family's `emit`), a word cost for `SizeEstimate`, and a stable name for the `StrategyCensus`.
//!
//! Interface-level lowering (stage IO, dispatch builtins, push fields) is planned per entry, not
//! per instruction, so it has no variant here.
