//! Which stages of a render or mesh pipeline use a direct texture or sampler argument once Metal
//! has linked the pipeline: Metal refuses a pipeline state that supports indirect command buffers
//! where one does.
//!
//! - **An object function** uses one where its pipeline's reflection says it does: a used binding
//!   of type texture or sampler ([`Binding::is_used`](super::Binding::is_used)), decided from the
//!   arguments' roles and use alone (An argument whose reflection Metal's answer has not been
//!   measured for no longer refuses the answer).
//! - **A fragment function** (It used the reflection's answer) uses one where an instruction its
//!   pipeline's linking keeps reads it: what reaches a side effect, a depth, stencil or sample mask
//!   output, or a color output its attachment writes ([`fragment_output`]), whether or not the
//!   pipeline rasterizes. A color output to an attachment the pipeline lacks or under a write mask
//!   of no channel is dropped, as Metal drops it (on an M4 under macOS 27.0.1).
//! - **A vertex or mesh function** uses one where an instruction its pipeline's linking keeps
//!   reads it (`live.rs`, the measured rule): what reaches the position and the other built-in
//!   outputs, a varying the fragment function reads, a side effect, or a branch, switch or loop
//!   any of those depend on. A varying no fragment input reads (one the fragment function
//!   declares and never reads, one it does not declare, or any where the pipeline has no fragment
//!   function or does not rasterize) is dropped with everything only it needs, though Metal's
//!   reflection still lists its texture as used (on an M4 under macOS 27.0.1).
//! - **What a fragment function reads** is a varying a kept instruction of its own reads, under
//!   the fragment function's own rule.
//! - **Proven or not** (a use only an unmeasured rule keeps must not read as Metal's refusal). The
//!   rules that keep beyond Metal where its answer is unmeasured ([`LinkedUseGap`]) each only add
//!   to what is kept, so the analysis runs first with all of them off: a use still kept is one
//!   Metal's measured rule keeps (proven, `gap: None`). Else, where it runs again with them on and
//!   the use is kept, the gap named is the first rule that keeps it alone, or, where none does, the
//!   first of the rules left once each that is not needed is dropped in turn. Each run is linear in
//!   the functions; a proven use takes one, an unused one two, and an unproven one at most ten.
