//! Machine-checkable bounds for C3's Apple readings.
//!
//! The user's decision of 2026-10-03 on the `apple_reading` entries: "Accept only within Apple's
//! bound". A reading is signed off only if every word in which the device differs from Metal is
//! within the accuracy Apple promises for what that word computes (MSL Tables 8.1, 8.2, and 8.3,
//! sections 8.1 and 8.5). So each reading declares its [`BoundedLane`]s: which output words compute
//! what MSL expression of which operands, under which math mode and in which format. [`check`]
//! recomputes every differing word from the case's own inputs: it reads each operand from the
//! case's buffer (or the thread-derived bit pattern the kernel builds), evaluates what Apple's rows
//! admit there ([`msl::admits`]), and judges the device's word, and Metal's as a check that the lane
//! describes the word. A word no lane covers, or one whose bound cannot be derived, is never within.
//!
//! Where Apple states no accuracy (fast `fmod` "Undefined", fast `sin` and `cos` "larger otherwise"
//! outside `[-pi, pi]`, the fast division outside its divisor domain, a NaN or INF under fast math),
//! any answer of the device conforms, by the user's rule, and [`UNSTATED_WORDS`] is the one flag
//! that would keep such words open instead. That reading covers the device's own answer, not the
//! product's approximation: where the product computes the word with an operation it records as a
//! near-equivalent of Metal's ([`near_equivalent`]: the product's own notes for the AIR operation
//! Metal compiles it to, [`AirOp`], on the row's venue profile and in the lane's math mode), the
//! user's standing rule keeps the word open until an exact path exists
//! ([`WordVerdict::NearEquivalent`]).
//!
//! Three notes record a difference that can be told value by value
//! ([`crate::observation_contract::value_difference`]): Metal's canonical NaN, its flush of
//! `float` denormals, and its rounding of a `half` to nearest even, each of which a device need
//! not share. A value within Apple's stated accuracy, or where Apple states none, that shows the
//! difference of such a note its row records is a near-equivalent as well, open with the exact
//! path that would close it; Apple's bound does not close it, because Metal's answer there is
//! reproducible. Every other value keeps its verdict.
