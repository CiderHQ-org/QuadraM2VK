//! The devices C3 judges the engine on: a committed list of venues, each a typed kind of
//! device, the operator environment its rows are recorded under, the cases it must cover, and the
//! device and driver its rows must have run on.
//!
//! The list is data (`validation/cutover/c3-venues.json`): another device is one more entry, never
//! new code. The report treats every venue alike; a venue's kind decides only which store backend
//! holds its rows and which device type its lane runs.
//!
//! **Driver drift.** Every engine row records the device it ran on (`environment`: the device
//! name, vendor and device IDs, and the driver's ID, version, and info string). A venue declares
//! the identities it allows ([`Venue::devices`], [`DeviceIdentity`]), and a row that recorded
//! another one is not the venue's evidence: C3 judges it stale. So when a driver is updated, rows
//! recorded under the new driver read stale until the venue's declared identities change, and once
//! they change, every row of the older driver reads stale until it is recorded again. Neither is
//! ever silently current. A venue allows several devices only when translation cannot tell them
//! apart: one driver build, and captures that derive one translation key (the Raptor Lake Xe-LP
//! venue allows the Iris Xe of RPL-P and the UHD Graphics 770 of RPL-S), so its slots can be
//! recorded on any of those machines. A device Metal runs on (an Apple GPU under MoltenVK) names
//! its own GPU's Metal reference environment ([`VenueDevice::metal_environment_id`]), and a run on
//! it is compared with that environment's rows alone, since Metal's own answers differ between
//! Apple GPUs.
//!
//! **Profile drift**. A venue's committed profile is a `vulkaninfo` capture of its own device
//! ([`VenueProfile`]), held to it in two halves. The list holds the profile to the venue's declared
//! identity ([`Venues::check_profiles`]), so a driver update recaptures the profile in the commit
//! that re-declares the identity. Each run recorded under a venue holds the live device to the
//! profile before it records anything ([`VenueCheck`]): its identity, and the translation key its
//! description derives, which covers every member translation reads at the device's API level. The
//! record keeps the profile's key; the one currency rule reads a record whose key is not its venue
//! profile's as stale ([`VenueKeys`]).
//!
//! **Build drift**. A venue's record of another build stays current while what it executed is this
//! build's artifact of its case on the slot's profile-leg: the digest the committed authored
//! compile census records at this build ([`VenueKeys::artifact_is_current`]).
