//! The killable worker boundary of validation sweeps.
//!
//! The engine is in-process only: it enforces its budgets deterministically (work units, the
//! byte ledger, the pre-emission size estimate, a transient wall deadline). The validation worker
//! is the backstop around it: one attempt per child process, supervised as a process group under
//! the 20-second and 500-MiB ceilings ([`process`]), with a counting global allocator ([`alloc`])
//! that both enforces the byte budget inside the child and measures the peak attributable bytes
//! that the ledger must account for.
//!
//! [`run_json`] is the one parent-side exchange: the input goes to the child's stdin from a
//! scratch file (no feeder thread per row), the child writes one JSON report to stdout
//! ([`report`]: its result, its counting allocator's process peak and its resident high water),
//! and every scratch file is removed before the call returns. The parent samples the group's RSS
//! every 10 ms, which can miss a short peak or a whole worker that runs between two samples: the
//! result's peak also takes the high water the worker states, and the allocator's peak, counted
//! exactly in the child, is recorded beside it in every result ([`Measured`]). Each member is
//! charged only memory of its own, never its parent's while it still runs in it ([`process`]),
//! and a supervising process gives its large freed buffers back to the system
//! ([`alloc::release_large_frees`]), so its own RSS does not grow from sweep to sweep.
//! [`compile`] runs every engine pipeline compile of a device-holding tool (L4 acceptance, the
//! engine candidate, the device tests) through it, and [`audit`] every attempt of the canon and
//! bitcode-reader audit lanes. [`device`] is the other boundary: the
//! engine candidate's device work runs in a child that the parent waits for without a deadline
//! or a ceiling (the child bounds its own device waits), so a driver fault ends the child, not the
//! tool. A translation worker whose attempt linked a module runs `spirv-val` in a fresh image of
//! itself ([`l3`]), so the attempt's peak is the larger of its translation's and its validation's,
//! never their sum.
