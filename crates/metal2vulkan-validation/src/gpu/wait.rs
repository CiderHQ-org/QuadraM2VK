//! Finite host waits on device work, and the hang protocol.
//!
//! Every host wait on submitted device work in this crate goes through this module, and every
//! one of them is bounded by [`wait_timeout()`] (10 s unless a command overrides it with
//! [`WAIT_TIMEOUT_FLAG`]). A unit test fails if an unbounded wait appears anywhere else.
//!
//! When a wait times out, the submission may still be running on the device:
//!
//! 1. nothing the submission uses is freed: the process never returns to the caller, so no
//!    destructor of an in-flight resource runs;
//! 2. for a GPU, the tripwire `~/.cache/m2v-gpu/hang` is written ([`tripwire::HangRecord`]), which
//!    stops every later GPU entry point on the host until a human has followed the
//!    suspected-hang protocol in `docs/VALIDATION.md`;
//! 3. the record is printed and the process leaves through `_exit(86)`, without running device
//!    destructors or `atexit` handlers.
//!
//! A wait that fails without telling whether the submission finished is handled like a timeout.
//!
//! A submission that completes with a device-fault status (Vulkan `VK_ERROR_DEVICE_LOST`; Metal
//! `MTLCommandBufferError` timeout, page fault, access revoked, or device removed) is a suspected
//! GPU fault: it writes the tripwire too, then fails the operation normally, because nothing is
//! in flight any more. A CPU implementation (lavapipe, SwiftShader) is an ordinary killable
//! process: its timeouts and faults follow the same exit rules but never write the host GPU
//! tripwire.
