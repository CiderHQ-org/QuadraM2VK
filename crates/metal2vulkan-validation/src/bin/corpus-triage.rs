[--profile P[+robustness-off]]...]]\n\n--audit authored-compile compiles every committed authored case of --corpus without a device, with the requests the engine executor builds for it (its constants, linked modules, bind shape, dispatch, companion stage, and device-replay variants), on each profile-leg of the expectation file (--expectations, by default authored-compile.tsv under the corpus root), each pipeline in a compile worker under the 20-s and 500-MiB ceilings, --jobs cases at once. Each case's outcome on each profile-leg (compiled, or the executor's refusal label) is cached in the index under the product's census key, the executor ABI, and the census's version, so a warm rerun compiles nothing; failures are never cached. It fails on any failed cell (an internal error, a worker stop, a case that does not check or map) and on any difference from the expectation file (a regression, a changed refusal, a newly compiled case, a new or removed case). --bless rewrites the file from the run and prints the differences (never with a failed cell); with --profile it compiles those profile-legs instead of the file's. --bless-additions (each train's gate step) compiles the file's profile-legs plus every C3 venue's profile-leg the file lacks (crates/metal2vulkan-validation/cutover/c3-venues.json), fails as a check does on any failed cell and on any changed cell of a case and profile-leg the file holds, writing nothing, and otherwise writes the file with the new cases and profile-legs added and the removed cases dropped, only when that changes it; its authored-compile-additions line counts what it added and removed. Each case is admitted, prepared, and compiled in its own case worker (a child of this binary under the 500-MiB ceiling, its wall ceiling 20 s plus 40 s per profile-leg), so this process holds only the committed cases and their cells; a case worker reads each private source by the byte range --index records (read only, never repaired), and one the index does not locate by parsing its whole shard (counted as sources_by_range and sources_by_shard). --case ID (repeatable) is a probe: it compiles only those committed cases (on --profile's profile-legs when named, else the file's), prints an authored-compile-cell line per cell with its outcome or failure and what its compiles measured, and compares those cases' rows with the expectation file when it exists; it never blesses. Host-replayed command buffers, whose pipelines the producer's records decide on the device, are reported as uncovered.\n\n--audit translation translates each row's retained bitcode (a public .ll row, which retains none, is assembled with llvm-as) with the engine for every --profile P (a committed profile under crates/metal2vulkan-validation/profiles, derived under the default untrusted policy), one profile after another, and records typed outcome classes under a per-profile census key (the product sources, SEMANTICS_VERSION, the lane's version, the profile, and the llvm-as and spirv-val versions; no other validation source); its summary is the non-gating shadow census. Rows stream from the index through the workers, so the parent's memory does not grow with --limit. --jobs defaults to the host's available logical CPU count (the equivalent of nproc). An explicit --jobs N overrides that default. --hash-file reads a whitespace-delimited SHA-256 from the first field of each non-empty line and audits exactly those indexed sources. --audit bitcode-reader decodes each selected row's retained bitcode with the engine's reader and compares its structure with llvm-dis (METAL2VULKAN_LLVM_DIS); it also reports the intrinsic census (calls decoded to air.*/llvm.* and every name kept as an unknown intrinsic, with rows, calls, and whether the decoder lists its family as not decoded) and every function called but declared without a body that is no intrinsic (what the module needs linked), with rows and calls; without --summary-only, each row's such functions too. Without --library-modules it only reads the index. With --library-modules it first syncs the library-module index with the module shards on disk (incrementally: only a new or changed shard is opened, and a warm index opens none), then selects the indexed library modules (the linked dependencies harvest retains apart from the sources) instead of the sources, in module-hash order after --after, at most --limit, reading only the selected modules' byte ranges. --audit bitcode-reader runs each attempt (a row's decode) in its own killable worker under the 20-s and 500-MiB ceilings: a stopped attempt is reported as worker-stopped <outcome> and counted in worker_stopped, beside the workers' peak RSS, allocator peak, and slowest time. --audit budgets reports the budget gates of each --profile P from the rows the current engine fingerprint recorded (slowest row, p50/p99 attempt time, peak worker RSS and the largest counting-allocator peak a worker reported, and the ledger >= 0.7 x allocator-peak check); a row stopped at the memory ceiling or by a worker abort, or refused at an in-process budget, fails it whatever its measure. It only reads the index and fails when a gate fails. Timeouts are transient and never recorded, so --audit budgets cannot see them; instead --audit translation exits non-zero when its batch has a budget stop (a timeout, OOM, worker abort, or in-process budget refusal) or a row above the 20-s or 500-MiB ceiling (its sampled RSS or its allocator peak), after reporting every profile (translation-audit-budgets-failure lines name them). Its outcome classes, shadow census, and batch ledger lines stay non-gating. --audit specialization first plans, in killable workers, every indexed row without a plan under the planner key (the product's sources, the lane's version, the census tools) or whose authored cases changed: the row's declared function constants and their value sets (the authored cases' sets; zero and one, which leave optional constants undefined; zero_defined and one_defined; a strength-2 binary covering array over every constant), kept whole when over the 16-set bound and reported. It plans at most --limit rows, in hash order (a row not yet planned has no set selected; the summaries count them). Then, for each --profile P in turn, it translates each planned set of each planned row, and each row whose current plain engine census outcome (which must cover every indexed row) is needs_input other than a function constant under the inputs set (no constants), at most --limit attempts (whole rows), each attempt in its own killable worker under the 20-s and 500-MiB ceilings, deriving the inputs the row's AIR states (a kernel's stage-input descriptor, a post-tessellation vertex descriptor, tile attachment formats, a storage texture's format, a visible function's retained module). Attempts are recorded in the lane's own table under the profile's engine census key extended by the lane's version; transient outcomes are not recorded. It prints the planning batch and the plans' summary (with the fifth function-constant operand's agreement with \"required\"), then per profile the batch (with its lanes and budgets) and the report over every recorded attempt: rows by plain outcome, outcomes by kind, inputs derived and left with their reasons, refusal classes ranked by rows with their value-dependent rows (ray-tracing classes listed apart), and the recorded attempts' budgets. It exits non-zero, after reporting everything, when a planning or attempt worker was stopped at or ran above a ceiling, or an attempt's ledger peak is below 7/10 of its allocator peak (each compile of an attempt is metered and measured on its own, and the attempt's cost is its last compile's)."
