//! Whole-corpus driver acceptance: does the Vulkan driver accept the pipeline we produce? Nothing
//! is bound, nothing is dispatched, nothing is read back.
//!
//! That question has no other asker in this repository. `spirv-val` checks the module against the
//! SPIR-V specification; the authored cases put a real pipeline on the device but reach only a
//! fraction of the sources. A module can be valid SPIR-V, translate without error, and still be
//! refused by the driver.
//!
//! It runs the engine: `--profile P` compiles every kernel (compute pipeline), vertex function
//! (rasterization-disabled render pipeline, with a vertex descriptor for the attributes it
//! declares), and fragment function (drawn with its generated passthrough vertex companion into
//!   the attachments its outputs imply) with the engine's public compile API for profile P
//!   (`acceptance::row`), and creates the pipeline from the **binder layout the artifact carries**
//!   (set layouts, push ranges, specialization, subgroup size, vertex input, graphics state). A
//!   kernel is created from the region the binder plans for one representative dispatch, a
//!   threadgroup of whole simdgroups (its specialization, stage flags, and required subgroup size,
//!   and a representative imageblock extent of one cell per thread where it has an explicit
//!   imageblock; `acceptance::dispatch`), as the executors create it, never at its stage's
//!   placeholder local size. The binder's typed refusal of that dispatch is `BIND_REFUSED`,
//!   counted; any other binder error is `BIND_ERROR` and fails the sweep. A render row's stages are
//!   created at their default specialization, not the graphics plan's (a limit). A fragment
//!   function's attachments have no more channels than its outputs write. It times each
//!   `vkCreate*Pipelines` (`budgets::CreationClock`: its wall time less its thread's wait for a
//!   CPU), with the drivers' shader disk caches off (`budgets::turn_driver_shader_caches_off`); a
//!   creation above 5 s is a bug. A row's detail
//!   prints its own stage's module words, which are what the translation sweep (`corpus-triage
//!   --audit translation`) counts for it, a render row's other stages' apart as `companion_words`,
//!   and a kernel's representative imageblock extent as `imageblock=WxH`, then the pipeline's
//!   precision notes as `precision=[...]`. `--robustness-off`
//!   compiles and creates every row in profile P's robustness-off leg, which the summary's `leg`
//!   names. `--driver-caches-on` leaves the drivers' shader disk caches as the environment sets
//!   them, so a creation may hit what an earlier process compiled: run twice, the second run times
//!   the warm creation a program's later launches see, beside the cold one the ceiling times (the
//!   summary's `driver_caches`). `--keep-modules DIR` writes each compiled row's stage modules,
//!   their specialization layouts and lowering strategies' words, and the MoltenVK MSL helper's
//!   configurations into DIR, a diagnostic (with `--compile-only` on any host): what a by-hand
//!   conversion and Metal compile of a row's module starts from. `--pulled` compiles every vertex
//!   attribute pulled in the shader instead of the projection the product derives: the repeatable
//!   form of the pulled sweep, with `--compile-only` or on a device. `--fixtures` sweeps the owned
//!   `validation/fixtures/public/engine` sources instead of the corpus, which is what the Linux
//!   containers can run. A row that retains no bitcode (a public source) is assembled from its AIR
//!   text.
//!
//! It compiles every row in a killable compile worker (this executable started with
//! `worker::compile::WORKER_ARG`) under the 20-s and 500-MiB ceilings, which cover assembling a
//! row's text and deriving its descriptor or companion; the pipeline comes back as its cache
//! artifact bytes, and a row the worker boundary stopped is `WORKER_STOPPED`, which fails the sweep
//! A row's last column is its compile worker's time in milliseconds (`-` where the worker reported
//! none), beside the creation's in the sixth.
//!
//! `--specializations FILE` sweeps only the corpus rows FILE lists, each compiled and created
//! with its listed function-constant values, its descriptor and companion derived under them
//! (`acceptance::row`): one JSON object per line, `{"row": "<source hash>", "set": <set>}`, the
//! set as the specialization planner writes it (`specialization::Specialization`; a constant it
//! does not supply stays undefined). Every other row compiles with no values, Metal's undefined,
//! where a row whose code uses a constant's value stops at `needs_input`. A row's detail then
//! starts with `set=<kinds>:<id>` (the set's kinds and the first 16 digits of its identity), and
//! the summary's `specializations` is the number of rows FILE lists (`none` without it).
//!
//! `--draws FILE` compiles and creates the draws an application logged instead of rows: one JSON
//! object per line, `{"id": <draw id>, "vertex": <source hash>, "fragment": <source hash>,
//! "template": <RenderTemplate>}`, each the vertex and fragment functions of two corpus rows
//! drawn together under the descriptor the application created the pipeline with (its vertex
//! descriptor, color attachments with their blend state and write masks, depth and stencil
//! formats, topology class and sample count; `acceptance::compile_draw_in_worker`), with no
//! function-constant values. A draw's line is keyed by its id, its entry is the two functions'
//! entries joined by `+`, and its stage `Draw`; the summary's `draws` is the number of draws
//! (`none` without it). A source a draw names that the corpus lacks fails the sweep.
//!
//! `--partition K/N` sweeps only the rows whose source shard is congruent to K modulo N, so N
//! processes sweep disjoint parts of the corpus side by side and none reads another's shards. A
//! refusal on MoltenVK carries the driver's report, and the row's last column names the Metal
//! compile step that failed and whether Metal's compiler service crashed or the step timed out
//! (`acceptance::metal_report`); the summary counts the rows per class.
//!
//! The device context puts back the loader's dispatch word that MoltenVK 1.4.1 overwrites when it
//! reports a message about the device, before the loader reads it again (in `vkDestroyDevice` at
//! exit, where a run faulted after its summary before; `candidate::platform::loader_word`).

     --keep-modules DIR writes each compiled row's stage modules into DIR (a diagnostic): per stage\n\
     <hash>.<stage>.spv, its entry point, specialization layout and strategy census (each lowering\n\

     --robustness-off compiles for P without its robustness features\n\
