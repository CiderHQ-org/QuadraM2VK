//! A worker's L3 stage, run in a fresh image of the worker's executable.
//!
//! The 500-MiB ceiling covers a whole attempt, `spirv-val` included: the parent samples the
//! worker's process group, so a validator run beside the translation's resident memory is
//! charged both at once. A 232K-instruction kernel translated in 303 MB, and `spirv-val` alone
//! held 427 MB on its 3.6M-word module; run from the translating process, the group passed the
//! ceiling at 527 MB. An attempt's peak is the larger of its translation's and its validation's,
//! never their sum.
//!
//! So a worker whose attempt linked a module ([`crate::engine::translate_unvalidated`]) does not
//! run `spirv-val` itself: [`report_after_l3`] writes the module's words and the provisional
//! result to the worker's scratch and replaces the process image with this executable's L3 stage
//! (`exec`). Nothing of the translation survives the exec: no IR, no ledger, no allocator arena.
//! The stage keeps the worker's pid and process group, so the parent's deadline and memory
//! sampling go on uninterrupted, runs `spirv-val` on the module's file without reading it
//! ([`serve`]), folds L3's result into the attempt ([`crate::engine::Attempt::settle_l3`]), and
//! writes the worker's one report, its allocator peak and resident high water each the larger of
//! the translation's and its own.
