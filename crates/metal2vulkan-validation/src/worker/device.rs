//! The engine candidate's device work in a child process.
//!
//! A Vulkan driver that faults kills the process holding its device: lavapipe at a 128-bit vector
//! width segfaults in every acceleration-structure build, and before this boundary that killed
//! `corpus-vulkan` (exit 139) and would have ended a sweep at the case. `execute`
//! runs the device half of one case (`candidate::engine::run_on_device`: open the device,
//! compile in a compile worker of its own, bind, submit, read back) in a child of the tool's own
//! executable started with [`WORKER_ARG`], and the tool keeps the device-free half (the checks, the
//! Metal observation, the comparison, the row). A child that dies by a signal is a typed
//! [`DeviceCrash`], never a row and never a match; for a GPU the parent first writes the host
//! tripwire, since whatever the child submitted may still be running.
//!
//! The exchange, step by step:
//!
//! 1. The parent writes a `DeviceInput` to the file that becomes the child's stdin: the case,
//!    the corpus root, the device type and backend, the bound of every device wait
//!    ([`wait_timeout()`]), the committed profile its contexts are restricted to
//!    (`--profiles-layer P`), the robustness leg they run under (`--robustness-off`), the
//!    read-only source index its private sources are read through (`--source-index`), and the
//!    digest of the input its own check produced. That is every process-wide setting the device
//!    half reads; the environment (the loader's and the layers' variables, `METAL2VULKAN_*`,
//!    `HOME`) is inherited.
//! 2. The child ([`serve_if_requested`]) sets the wait bound, reads private sources through the
//!    parent's source index if it was handed one, restricts its contexts to P and
//!    sets their leg and its generated-commands setting before it opens any device, turns on the
//!    validation layer's echo (`candidate::echo_validation_messages`: each failing message goes
//!    to stderr as the layer reports it, at most as many as a row keeps, so a crash still shows
//!    them), admits and prepares the case again, requires the parent's input digest, runs it,
//!    and reports `Result<DeviceRun, ExecutorError>` with its build identity: its product
//!    fingerprint ([`TRANSLATOR_FINGERPRINT`]) and its validation-crate fingerprint
//!    ([`VALIDATION_FINGERPRINT`]), since it runs this crate's executor (binding, readback, the
//!    comparison class, the census, the environment) as well as the product; and with whether its
//!    contexts enabled `VK_EXT_device_generated_commands`.
//! 3. The parent waits without a deadline or a memory ceiling: a GPU child is never killed while
//!    it may have work in flight. The run is therefore bounded only as far as the child bounds
//!    itself: every device wait (`gpu::wait`) and its compile (its compile worker) are; a driver
//!    call that never returns, such as creating a device or a pipeline, holds the parent, as it
//!    held the tool before the device moved out. The parent then classifies the exit (`Ended`)
//!    before it writes anything, so a GPU child's crash writes the tripwire first; only then does
//!    it relay the child's stderr, ignoring a closed stream. A report is decoded and refused
//!    unless the child's build identity and generated-commands setting are the parent's and its
//!    census names the parent's restriction and leg; the hang protocol's exit comes back to
//!    `execute`, which leaves with the same status once the scratch files are gone, as the
//!    in-process wait did; a signal is a [`DeviceCrash`]; any other exit is `Failed`, with the
//!    stderr.
