//! Engine pipeline compiles under the worker boundary.
//!
//! Every validation path that compiles an engine pipeline for a device (L4 driver acceptance,
//! `corpus-pipeline`, and the engine candidate executor behind
//! `corpus-vulkan`/`corpus-moltenvk`) compiles in a killable child
//! process, never in the process that holds the Vulkan device. [`compile_compute`],
//! [`compile_compute_request`], and [`compile_render_request`] run one child per pipeline
//! through [`super::run_json`], so the 20-second
//! deadline (input preparation through decoding the artifact), the 500-MiB process-group RSS
//! limit, and the process-group kill apply to the compile.
//!
//! The recipe (`docs/HOWTO.md` section 5), step by step:
//!
//! 1. The input is the source of each library the request's functions come from (one, or a
//!    draw's two: the case's and its generated companion's), then each library of the functions
//!    they link, each a [`RowSource`]: its bitcode, or AIR text (a public row that retains none, a
//!    generated companion) the child assembles with `llvm-as` under its own deadline; the
//!    [`PipelineRequest`] (kind, entries, function constants, linked functions); and the device's
//!    `DeviceDescription` and `DevicePolicy` ([`WorkerDevice`]), from which the child rebuilds the
//!    parent's `Device`. The parent writes it to the file that becomes the child's stdin.
//! 2. The child ([`serve_if_requested`]) refuses to serve without the counting allocator, sets its
//!    500-MiB budget, and compiles through the public API ([`compile_pipeline`]:
//!    `Device::compile_compute_pipeline` or `Device::compile_render_pipeline`) under a `Budget`
//!    with the 20-s deadline.
//! 3. The parent polls the group (deadline, RSS) and kills it on any breach ([`super::run_json`]).
//! 4. The child writes the pipeline's cache artifact bytes (`PipelineArtifact::to_bytes`) to the
//!    file the parent names in [`ARTIFACT_FILE`], a chunk at a time (`PipelineArtifact::write_to`),
//!    so reporting holds little beside the pipeline: a constant blob the ledger admits is never
//!    encoded whole in memory, let alone as base64. It reports the artifact's length with the table
//!    handles of each request function's linked functions ([`crate::acceptance::LinkedHandles`]),
//!    together with the SHA-256 of the input bytes it decoded and its product fingerprint. The
//!    parent requires that digest to be its own input's and that fingerprint to be its own (an
//!    executable rebuilt since the parent started is another compiler, whose pipeline the parent's
//!    observations would misattribute), requires the file to hold the reported length, decodes the
//!    bytes with `PipelineArtifact::from_bytes` for the kind it asked for against its own `Device`
//!    (so bytes of another profile are `WrongDevice`, and stale, corrupt, or other-kind bytes are
//!    refused), requires the handles to answer its request (`PipelineRequest::check_handles`), and
//!    re-checks the deadline after decoding.
//! 5. A typed product refusal comes back as its [`Outcome`] (deterministic), a library whose
//!    source gives no bitcode as the row's outcome (`BitcodeError::attempt`), and pipeline
//!    inputs the tool does not build for the function as [`NotCompiled::Unmodelled`]; a stop at
//!    the boundary is a [`WorkerFailure`] (the caller reports it, never retries with another
//!    input).
//!
//! The recipe's parent-side key check (`Device::compute_pipeline_key` of the request) needs a
//! `Function`, which for a bare AIR module (every validation input) exists only after
//! `Library::from_air` decodes the whole module: computing it in the parent would put exactly the
//! input-scaled decode the boundary exists to contain back into the parent. The input digest
//! stands in for it here: the parent verifies that the child compiled the bytes it wrote.
