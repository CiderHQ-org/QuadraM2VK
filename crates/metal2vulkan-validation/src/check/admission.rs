//! Executor admission: what may run where, decided before any device opens.
//!
//! The Metal oracle and the Vulkan candidate take an [`AdmittedCase`], which only [`admit`]
//! constructs. Admission checks the case and then applies the GPU rules:
//!
//! - the Metal oracle runs a loop-free case as compiled and any other case only through
//!   fuel-instrumented AIR, so it refuses a cyclic case whose cycles the fuel transform cannot all
//!   bound ([`FuelScope::Uncovered`]).
//! - the engine candidate is not held to loop-freedom: its modules run as compiled, cyclic ones
//!   included, on every device (the user's decision of 2026-10-02). Nothing here stops a submitted
//!   shader that does not end, since submitted commands are not cancelled: the finite device wait
//!   ends only the host's wait (the run fails), the per-run timeout ends only the host process, and
//!   the hang tripwire only refuses later runs. The OS or driver GPU timeout is what stops the
//!   shader.
//!
//! A refusal is its own outcome, [`ExecutionRefused`]: never a tooling requirement, never a
//! mismatch, and never evidence. A run the engine executor cannot perform (the product
//! refused the case, the device did not enable what it needs, or the executor does not
//! implement a resource yet) is [`NotSupported`], also never evidence. A candidate run with no
//! current Metal observation to compare against is [`NeedsMetal`]: the case needs Metal
//! qualification first.
