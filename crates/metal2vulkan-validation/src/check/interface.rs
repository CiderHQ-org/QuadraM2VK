//! The Metal-ABI facts of one checked entry, from the AIR input layer.
//!
//! The checker compares an authored manifest against what Metal itself binds: argument-table
//! slots and their counts, argument-buffer members with their byte offsets and `[[id]]`s, the
//! declared access of each argument, the stage interface, and the function-constant declarations.
//! Every one of those is a fact of the AIR the Metal oracle loads, so it is read from the decoded
//! module's typed [`AirAbi`] and IR, never from a translation: a product change cannot move a
//! Metal slot under an installed case, and the Metal observations recorded against these facts
//! survive the rewrite.
//!
//! - **Resolution.** An index, count, attachment, or predicate the metadata states as a global
//!   resolves to the value the static initializer leaves there for the case's function constants
//!   ([`canon::static_values`]). A parameter whose predicate is false is not *live*: Metal drops
//!   it from the specialized function, so the case need not bind it, but may (a function-constant
//!   alternative sharing its slot). Only the constants the AIR declares are bound; Metal ignores
//!   the rest. A value the AIR layer does not evaluate (a static initializer computes it through
//!   an operation outside the evaluated subset) stays unknown and never becomes a guess: an
//!   unknown predicate makes its argument optional, an unknown count leaves the range unsized, and
//!   an unknown slot is an error for a live argument and drops an optional one. Each is named in
//!   [`AirInterface::unresolved`]. Any other failure to evaluate is the checker's error.
//! - **Access.** A buffer is written when AIR declares it writable or when the IR stores through
//!   a pointer derived from it: the compiler annotates some written buffers `air.read`, and the
//!   question the checker asks is whether the shader can write the resource, not what its
//!   qualifier spells. Any pointer an intrinsic, an unknown, or an indirect call receives counts
//!   as written, which only ever widens the answer.
//! - **Texture shapes.** AIR metadata spells a texture's type only as a name. Its shape and texel
//!   class come from the `air.*` texture operations that use it, whose typed operand positions
//!   state both ([`Texture`](metal2vulkan_air::intrinsics::Texture)); a texture no operation uses
//!   has no shape.
//! - **Types.** Attributes, outputs, and constants are compared by the IR type of the value (float
//!   or integer, width, lanes). The IR does not carry an integer's sign, so neither does this
//!   comparison; the executors pass the authored format to Metal, which checks it.
//!
//! Origins are followed through casts, GEPs, `select`, `phi`, and calls to defined functions,
//! and one level of memory: a pointer or handle loaded from a parameter's memory at a known byte
//! offset is that parameter's member or table element there. A pointer loaded from any other
//! memory has no origin, and a write through it is not attributed.
