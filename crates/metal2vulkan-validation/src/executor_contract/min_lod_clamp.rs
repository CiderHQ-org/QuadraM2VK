//! A kernel that samples with a `min_lod_clamp`.
//!
//! Apple's compiler service crashes building the compute pipeline of a kernel that samples a
//! texture at an implicit level with a positive or NaN `min_lod_clamp`: `makeComputePipelineState`
//! fails with `XPC_ERROR_CONNECTION_INTERRUPTED` (macOS 26.7, M3 Max, Metal 32023.921). Measured:
//!
//! - `a2_kernel_lod_filter` itself, by the oracle's route for a public fixture (`metal-as`,
//!   `metallib`, the compute pipeline): its clamp-only call and its bias-and-clamp call each crash
//!   it, at its run-time clamp and at a constant 1; with both clamps zeroed it builds. Its case
//!   (`a9d1ba8d`) was interrupted the same way at oracle v35. With both clamps set to one
//!   constant, it crashes at 2^-24, 0.25, 1, 2, 15, 1000, +infinity, and a quiet NaN
//!   (`0x7FF8000000000000`), and builds at 0, -0.25, -1, -1000, and -infinity.
//! - Kernels in MSL: a constant and a run-time clamp, with and without a bias, on a 2D texture,
//!   and a run-time clamp on a 2D array, a 3D, and a cube texture and in a 2D depth texture's
//!   `sample_compare`, all crash; so did the Apple report's bicubic, linear, nearest, and argument
//!   samplers at a constant clamp. `min_lod_clamp(0.0f)`, `bias` alone, a plain sample, and a
//!   compare without a clamp build, and so does a sample with gradients and a run-time clamp.
//! - Fragment functions build with every one of those 2D forms, and a vertex function with
//!   gradients and a clamp builds.
//!
//! So Metal has no answer for such a kernel: [`ToolingRequirement::KernelMinLodClamp`] is Metal's
//! own limit ([`Limit::Metal`]), which stops every executor and closes its row without a reference.
//!
//! The scan claims only the measured forms, since the requirement closes a row. Every measured
//! kernel was a compute kernel: a kernel with no imageblock, built by `makeComputePipelineState`. A
//! tile function (a kernel with implicit imageblock attachments, built as a render pipeline's tile
//! stage) and a kernel with `[[imageblock]]` tiles were not measured, so the scan is given the
//! declared reflection of the entry and claims nothing for either ([`compute_kernel`]), nor for a
//! source that does not reflect. It reads the entry's text, as classification does (the
//! module, or its projection onto the entry for a module that declares several), in the entry's
//! function and the functions it reaches by direct calls, which its pipeline compiles. A call
//! counts when the product decodes its `air.*` name as a sample at an implicit level (`i1 false` at
//! its `TexRole::LodMode` position: no option, or a bias) of a 2D, 2D array, 3D, or cube colour
//! texture, or as a compare sample of a 2D depth texture, and its operand at `TexRole::MinLodClamp`
//! is a value computed at run time or a constant that is not at most zero: positive (finite or
//! +infinity) or a NaN, the split the measured constants follow. Positive constants outside the
//! measured 2^-24 to 1000, and NaNs of another sign or payload, are claimed by that split,
//! unmeasured; -0.0, which compares equal to zero, is no claim, as zero and every measured negative
//! constant build. A sample with gradients is no claim (it builds), and neither is an explicit
//! level, another texture shape, a clamp spelled otherwise (`undef`, `poison`, a constant
//! expression), or a call whose operands the layout does not read: none was measured, so such a row
//! stays authorable, and a case of it meets Metal's answer, or its failure, at the oracle. Every
//! measured call was in the entry's own body. A call in a function the entry reaches by direct
//! calls is claimed as one there, unmeasured, since the pipeline compiles both; one in a function
//! the entry reaches only through a pointer (a function table, an indirect call) or not at all is
//! no claim.
