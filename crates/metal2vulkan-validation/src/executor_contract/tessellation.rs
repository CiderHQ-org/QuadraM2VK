//! How both executors draw a tessellation case: the Metal oracle's `MTLRenderPipelineDescriptor`
//! tessellation fields, `setTessellationFactorBuffer:offset: instanceStride:`, `setCullMode:`, and
//! `drawPatches:...`, and the engine candidate's `RenderPipelineDescriptor::tessellation`,
//! `BindState::tessellation_factors`, cull mode, and `DrawCall::Patches`, derived once here, so the
//! two agree.
//!
//! A case's patches are drawn from patch 0 with no patch index buffer, as many instances as the
//! case states from base instance 0, `numberOfPatchControlPoints` the function's
//! `[[patch(_, N)]]`. Each patch's factors are its half-precision edge factors then its inside
//! factors, little-endian, in one buffer bound at offset 0 with instance stride 0, read per patch
//! (`MTLTessellationFactorStepFunctionPerPatch`), never scaled. The pipeline partitions as the
//! case states (integer when it states nothing), clamps every factor to at most 64, winds its
//! output as the case states (counter-clockwise when it states nothing), and reads no
//! control-point index buffer; the encoder culls as the case states (nothing when it states
//! nothing) with Metal's default clockwise front face. Changing any of it changes the oracle's
//! draws, which is a Metal oracle version (`crate::metal::ORACLE_ABI`) and an engine executor
//! version together.
