//! The engine's typed refusals as committed evidence.
//!
//! A case the engine executor refuses writes no row. When it refused the case after opening
//! the device (the product's refusal at compile, the binder's, a pipeline requirement the device
//! did not enable, a containment form the device leaves open), the executor stores a
//! [`RefusalObservation`] in the slot the row would have taken: the case, the build, the opened
//! device's facts (the `environment` a row records, its identity and profile among them), and the
//! typed [`Refusal`]. A slot holds a row or a refusal, never both: the store's write of either
//! removes the other. A refusal before any device opened (a tooling requirement, a case the
//! executor cannot map) is not a fact about a device and is not stored: the case was not run.
//!
//! C3 reads these records: a current refusal is `refused`, not `missing`, and a device gap C1's
//! reviewed list holds for the venue's profile is `device_gap` (`c3`). A refusal is current by the
//! rows' rule: the build (the executor ABI and the translator fingerprint of the recorded
//! profile), the case's inputs, and the venue's declared device and driver.
