//! The validation layer's message about a descriptor set layout a driver refuses through
//! `vkGetDescriptorSetLayoutSupport` though it makes and runs it.
//!
//! MoltenVK answers the query `sum of descriptorCount < maxPerSetDescriptors` (1212 on Apple's
//! GPUs), though it encodes an update-after-bind set in a Metal argument buffer and runs one of
//! 65536 elements and more as Metal runs the argument buffer
//! (`RuntimeDriverDefect::SetLayoutSupportUnderstated`). The runtime makes a heap's set 1 there
//! past that answer, announced (`Degradation::SetPastLayoutSupport`). The layer asks the query for
//! every layout past `maxPerSetDescriptors` and reports one it refuses, as Vulkan says it must
//! (`VUID-vkCreateDescriptorSetLayout-support-09582`, "If the descriptor layout exceeds the limits
//! reported through the physical device limits, then vkGetDescriptorSetLayoutSupport must have
//! returned VkDescriptorSetLayoutSupport with support equal to VK_TRUE for pCreateInfo"). That is
//! no layer defect: the use is outside what the driver's query admits, and the measured defect is
//! what licenses it.
//!
//! [`shape`] matches exactly that message: the layer's format, "`pCreateInfo` was passed to
//! vkGetDescriptorSetLayoutSupport which reported this layout is not supported", read in
//! Vulkan-ValidationLayers 1.4.363 (`CoreChecks::ValidateDescriptorSetLayoutSupport`), at
//! `vkCreateDescriptorSetLayout`, as the lanes saw it on MoltenVK 1.4.2, alone or after the
//! layer's note on its last report (`duplicate_message_limit`). The runtime lanes' sink
//! passes it only once the runtime announced `Degradation::SetPastLayoutSupport`
//! (`runtime_case.rs`). Every other message, and this one before the notice, still fails.
