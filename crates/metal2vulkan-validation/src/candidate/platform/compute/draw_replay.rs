//! Device replay of executed render commands in the engine executors: an execution of render
//! commands runs on the device where the runtime's GPU form draws it, by the rules both share
//! (`bind::replay`'s draw replay rules), so the executor compiles and draws what the runtime does,
//! and the records never return to the host to decide what runs.
//!
//! - **Which executions.** The rules decide from the case's facts alone, never from the records:
//!   a range of commands of a buffer of draws of one primitive type alone under the encoder's
//!   pipeline state, with their own buffers (`draw_replay_primitive_type`), from what the records
//!   may hold: the host's setters' (`CommandBufferResource::host_writes`) and what the functions of
//!   the case's own dispatch or draw may write (`PipelineInterface::command_writes`; its encoder
//!   makes every command buffer resident for writing, as the case runner's does); the inherited
//!   state's functions (`draw_replay_state`), and its draw instantiated in the variant's form
//!   (`draw_replay_draw`); and a device with device addresses (`draw_replay_module`,
//!   `draw_replay_preprocess`). The runtime's rules of its own hold of every case the runner
//!   makes: it passes no check, counts no visibility result, and its pass (the template's
//!   scaffolding) reaches no tile memory and draws nothing before the execution. An execution a
//!   rule keeps from the device, or whose variant, plan, draw or preprocess the product refuses,
//!   runs the host replay (`replay::execute_commands`), as the runtime records it at its host step.
//! - **What runs.** The parent's render template's draw replay variant (`ChildCommand::
//!   DrawReplay`), compiled in a compile worker for the bind state of the execution's encoder (the
//!   parent's vertex buffers bound, every allocation of the run resident in the vertex and fragment
//!   stages, as the oracle's `useResource` makes them): merged into one draw where the commands
//!   draw a list type or points and the merged form's rules hold (`draw_replay_merges`), else one
//!   draw per command. One command buffer records the product's preprocess over the range (its
//!   scratch holding the parameters, the resident root table of every allocation with the sink
//!   filled, the extents, the parent's buffers and a merged replay's header), a merged replay's two
//!   merge passes (`draw_merge_module`), then, in the template's pass, the variant's draws: per
//!   command one `vkCmdDrawIndirect` of one draw at its arguments with its slot tables at the
//!   variant's root-table holes, or the merged draw's two (`render::submit_replayed_draws`).
//! - **After the wait**, the status: a replay fault refuses the row for the product's typed limits
//!   and fails it otherwise (`engine::replay_fault_verdict`), then the status verdict. The census
//!   holds the variant once per execution: the one draw of it the runtime's execution record holds.
//!   The artifact holds it as a pipeline the authored compile census does not compile, as the
//!   runtime path's holds every pipeline its executed commands ran.
