//! Device replay of executed compute commands in the engine compute executor.
//!
//! After the producer completed and every command buffer's records passed the host contract's
//! decode (as for the host replay, `validate_records`), each executed compute command buffer runs
//! its execution range on the device where the product sets the device replay up
//! (`replay_preprocess_module`: a device with device addresses) and the case registers a
//! variant: the records are never decoded to drive what runs. The consumer side is the
//! product's contract (`docs/API.md`, "GPU-encoded compute commands on the device"):
//!
//! - every registered variant ([`ReplayVariant`]: a compute template's pipeline token, threadgroup
//!   size, and threadgroup lengths, `engine::replay_variants`) is compiled in a compile worker
//!   with `LoweringInputs::replay_bindings` (`ChildCommand::ReplayVariant`), planned for a bind
//!   state that sets its threadgroup lengths, binds no kernel buffer, and makes every allocation
//!   of the run resident (as the oracle's `useResource` does), and instantiated with
//!   `BindingPlan::instantiate_replay`;
//! - one command buffer records the product's preprocess over the range (its scratch holding the
//!   parameters, the resident root table with the sink filled, the variants, and the parent
//!   encoder's state, as `replay_preprocess` states them, with the product's most regions per
//!   command, `MAX_REPLAY_REGIONS`), a barrier, and then per command in range order, per region
//!   (a ragged grid's edges and a group count's chunks past the device's limit), and per variant
//!   `vkCmdDispatchIndirect` from the arguments of the command's region with the command's slot
//!   table as the root table and the region's record as the region, a compute barrier between
//!   commands;
//! - after the wait, the status: a replay fault (a command dispatched nothing) refuses the row
//!   for the product's typed limits and fails it for every other reason
//!   (`engine::replay_fault_verdict`); the census holds each variant once per command whose
//!   arguments selected it in any region.
//!
//! Where the context enabled `VK_EXT_device_generated_commands` (`VulkanContext::
//! generated_commands`), the variants are compiled first and the product's
//! `replay_preprocess_generated` sets up the generated-commands path: the same preprocess writes
//! each command's sequences and each possible segment's count in place of the arguments, and the
//! command buffer records one `vkCmdExecuteGeneratedCommandsEXT` per command of the range
//! ([`generated`]) in place of the dispatches. Where the product refuses that path
//! (`ReplayRefusal::GeneratedCommands`: a limit the device states, or variants that bind other
//! descriptors), K14c's dispatches run instead; the environment names which ran.
//!
//! A render command buffer, a device without device addresses, and a case that registers no
//! variant run the host replay (`replay::execute_commands`).
