//! The members of an engine case's argument buffers, bound the same way by the compute and the
//! render executor.
//!
//! A case authors each member by its owner (the Metal buffer index of the argument buffer that
//! holds it) and the byte offset of its field in the owner. The Metal oracle creates the member,
//! writes it into the owner with its argument encoder (Tier 2), and makes it resident for reading
//! and writing (`useResource:usage:`, on a render encoder with `stages: Vertex | Fragment`). The
//! executor does the same in the binder's terms: the owner, a buffer of the function's own stage,
//! is created holding at each field the 8 bytes the encoder writes there ([`field_words`],
//! [`owner_bytes`]), and each member is what the binder takes for it:
//!
//! - a buffer is its guest address in the owner and a used resource of class `Buffer`
//!   ([`used_buffer`]), so the resident set reaches it and a loaded pointer is translated through
//!   it;
//! - a texture is its `gpuResourceID` in the owner and a used resource of class `Texture` with
//!   that resource id ([`used_texture`]): a heap member, which the plan writes into every heap
//!   array whose class holds it and enters in each stage's handle table, so a handle loaded from
//!   the field finds its element;
//! - a command buffer is its `gpuResourceID` in the owner, a small integer of its own
//!   ([`records_ids`]), and its record storage an argument-buffer buffer at the guest address the
//!   product resolves that ID at (`records_address`, [`records_storage`]), which the product's
//!   encoder writes each command through, and which the run checks as the host contract decodes it
//!   ([`embed_objects`], [`validate_records`]);
//! - a sampler is its `gpuResourceID` in the owner and an argument sampler of the bind state with
//!   that id ([`embed_samplers`], [`sampler_ids`]): the plan writes it into each sampler array
//!   and enters it in each stage's sampler table, so a sampler loaded from the field finds its
//!   element;
//! - a pipeline state is the case's token for it in the owner and nothing else: the product reads
//!   the field's word only as an encoder's operand and refuses every other use of the handle and
//!   every access but the handle load that may reach the field's bytes (`ArgumentBufferObjects`),
//!   so no observation depends on it but through the records, and the binder has no class for one.
