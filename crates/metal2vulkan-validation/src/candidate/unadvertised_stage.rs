//! The validation layer's message about a vertex module's subgroup operations on a driver that
//! runs them as Metal does though its `subgroupSupportedStages` leaves the vertex stage out.
//!
//! MoltenVK 1.4.1 hands a vertex function to Metal, which runs it in simdgroups of 32 consecutive
//! vertices; measured on the M3 Max and the M4, its subgroup operations there are Metal's
//! (`DriverDeviation::MetalVertexSimdgroups`). A profile that takes that deviation compiles them,
//! and the module requires `VkProperty::MetalVertexSimdgroups` in place of the vertex stage. The
//! layer checks the stage against `subgroupSupportedStages`, as Vulkan says it must
//! (`VUID-RuntimeSpirv-None-06343`, "Group operations with subgroup scope must not be used if the
//! shader stage is not in subgroupSupportedStages"), and so reports each such shader module. That is
//! no layer defect: the use is outside what the driver advertises, and the deviation is what
//! licenses it.
//!
//! [`shape`] matches exactly that message about the vertex stage alone: the layer's format,
//! "`<opcode>` is used in `<stages>` which is not supported in subgroupSupportedStages
//! (`<stages>`).", read in Vulkan-ValidationLayers v1.4.357 (its library's strings), with the
//! stages `[VK_SHADER_STAGE_VERTEX_BIT]` at `vkCreateShaderModule`, as the lanes saw it, or
//! `VK_SHADER_STAGE_VERTEX_BIT`. A sink passes it only where the device's profile takes the
//! deviation: the runtime lanes' sink once the runtime announced
//! `Degradation::UnadvertisedVertexSimdgroups` (`runtime_case.rs`), the executor's context where
//! the profile it opened takes the deviation (`platform/device.rs`). Every other subgroup-stage
//! message, and this one anywhere else, still fails.
