//! A draw's vertex stage reading bytes a fragment stage of its render pass wrote
//! (`runtime/render/pass_start_reads.rs`) on the device the cfg selects, under the validation
//! layer.
//!
//! a probe (an M3 Max, and an M4; plain and validated, 20 runs a case) drew, in one render pass, a
//! draw whose fragments write a buffer and then draws whose vertex function reads the written
//! bytes: the vertex stage read the bytes from before the pass in every run, and plain Metal
//! ignored a memory barrier from the fragment stage to the vertex stage
//! (Metal's validation stops it). Here the owned fixture `rt6_attachmentless`'s `rt6_mark_sample`
//! ORs bit 0 into word 0 of a buffer over the probe pass of `render_state`, whose `rt6_full` then
//! draws at the depth word 0 holds: 0.5 (`0x3f00_0000`) from before the pass, where the written
//! word is `0x3f00_0001`.
//!
//! a probe (the M3 Max, and an M4) found the same of an indirect command buffer's commands, behind
//! their barrier or not, and the other order too: an earlier draw's fragments read what a later
//! draw's vertex function wrote, and their write outlasts the later one's. A command's vertex stage
//! reads the copy taken before the pass here; a vertex stage's write of bytes a fragment stage of
//! its pass read or wrote is announced (`fragments-before-geometry`).
