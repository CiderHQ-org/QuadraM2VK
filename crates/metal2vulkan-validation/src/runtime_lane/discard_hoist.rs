//! A simdgroup sum before a discard of whole quads, in the thirteen shapes measured for where
//! Metal's compiler places it, on the device the cfg selects, under the validation layer.
//!
//! The owned fixture `fragment_discard_hoist` draws Metal's fullscreen triangle over an 8x4
//! `RGBA32Sint` target cleared to -7, keeping one quad (`kept_quads` 1, pixels (0..2, 0..2)) and
//! discarding every other quad whole. Each kept thread writes `(before > after, after - kept,
//! (before - after) & 3, before < after)` from its simdgroup's lane counts before the discard and
//! after it: values that hold however a device packs quads into simdgroups.
//!
//! Metal's answer, as Apple M4 and M3 Max give it (from the fixture's AIR and from source, with and
//! without the debug layer), is `(0, 0, 0, 0)` for every `hoisted_*` shape (Metal's compiler moves
//! the sum past the discard, so it counts only the kept quad's lanes) and `(1, 0, 0, 0)` for every
//! `counted_*` shape (the sum counts the dropped quads that share the kept quad's simdgroup).
//!
//! The compile layer moves the sum where Metal's compiler moves it and keeps it ahead of the
//! discard where Metal does, so a device whose fragment subgroup holds the kept quad with at
//! least one dropped quad gives Metal's answer for every shape whose placement is known. Two are
//! not: `counted_call_use` (arithmetic reads the sum between) and `hoisted_nested` (a nested
//! discard, which Metal placed both ways), where the module keeps the sum ahead of the discard
//! and records `QuadsCountedBeforeDiscard`: `hoisted_nested` answers `(1, 0, 0, 0)` there, the
//! noted residue. A device whose fragment subgroups hold fewer than two quads
//! (`AnswerGap::FragmentSubgroupUnderTwoQuads`, decided from its description as C3 decides it)
//! cannot place a dropped quad beside the kept one, so every shape answers `(0, 0, 0, 0)` there:
//! a valid Metal answer for a partly occupied simdgroup, and that gap. `RECORDED` holds a measured
//! venue's answers where they differ from these.
//!
//! Measured: RADV (Radeon 780M, subgroup 64), RTX 3090 and RTX 5080 (32), ANV
//! (Iris Xe RPL-P, 32), and lavapipe x86 (8) give these answers, the noted residue included;
//! lavapipe arm64 (fragment subgroup 4, the gap) answers `(0, 0, 0, 0)` for all thirteen; MoltenVK
//! on Apple M4 answers `hoisted_nested` as Metal does (`RECORDED`).
