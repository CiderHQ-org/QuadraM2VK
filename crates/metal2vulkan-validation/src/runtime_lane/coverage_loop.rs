//! Device tests of the loop over the covered samples on the device the cfg selects, under the
//! validation layer, over the owned fixture `coverage_loop`: fragment functions that read
//! `[[sample_mask]]` and that Metal runs once per covered sample.
//!
//! - Each function the loop does not fit is refused at 4 samples with its typed reason, through
//!   `Device::new_render_pipeline_state` as a Metal program makes the pipeline: early fragment
//!   tests as not representable; a discard, a derivative, a simdgroup operation and a color
//!   attachment read as not implemented. A device whose driver splits a clipped triangle's
//!   pixel-rate fragments (lavapipe) may refuse the coverage read for that first, and a device
//!   lacking a feature the function needs anyway, for that; none is ever made.
//! - The two the loop fits draw the fullscreen triangle over a 2x2 pass without attachments, as
//!   `runtime_lane::attachmentless` draws: at 4 samples each pixel's union of the coverages its
//!   runs read, the union of their samples, its runs, and no run outside its coverage (what any
//!   split of the pixel leaves alone, Metal's answer); at 2 samples, where Apple's rasterizer
//!   splits no pixel of this pass, each covered sample's run reading the pixel's coverage, once.
//! - The sample-qualified varying (`cov_loop_varying`) draws the same triangle over a 1x1 pass,
//!   whose quad holds three helper invocations, and over the 2x2 one, whose quad is four covered
//!   pixels, at 2 and 4 samples where the device takes the count without attachments: each
//!   covered sample's run reads the varying at the sample's standard position, which every lane
//!   device reports and Metal's answers at 2 and 4 samples are. A driver whose interpolation at a
//!   sample needs the whole quad (RADV) read garbage in the 1x1 pass until the entry read the
//!   varyings before the loop. At 8 samples, which an Apple GPU does not rasterize, its pipeline is
//!   Metal's error on every device.
