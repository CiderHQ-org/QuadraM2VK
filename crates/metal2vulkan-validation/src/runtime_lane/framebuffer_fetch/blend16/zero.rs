//! `fbl_fetch_blend16` but compiled without fast math. Color 0 is a `SIDE`² private `RGBA16Float`
//! target blended ([`blends`]) with a zero factor beside each other factor the guest's blends read,
//! either way round, and two zero factors, under each operation, for color and alpha alike; color
//! 1 an `RGBA16Float` target of mask none. Each function reads color 0 and returns, at pixel
//! `i = SIDE · y + x`, a loaded source chosen by the fetched alpha (`src[i + SIDE²]` where it
//! exceeds 2, else `src[i]`): `fbl_safe_loaded` a `half4`, `fbl_safe_loaded_float` a `float4`. One

//! `RGBA16Float` and `RG16Float` from `half4` and `float4` outputs, three seeds of 16,384 pixels
//! whose sources and texels hold signed zeros, infinities and NaNs: every lane): each product
//! rounded in the output's arithmetic, a zero factor's kept (`x · 0`: a NaN where `x` is an
//! infinity or a NaN, else a zero of the signed operand's sign), their IEEE 754 sum rounded (`-0`
//! only where both terms are `-0`); a `float4` output's result converted to `half` toward zero;
//! `SourceAlphaSaturated` the minimum of the source alpha and one minus the destination's, a NaN
//! operand giving the other and two zeros `+0`; every NaN stored as `0x7e00`. The texels and
//! sources are those of the parent's sweep, but one in four a special: a signed zero, an infinity,
//! a NaN (the texels' of either sign) or one, so a zero factor meets each and the saturated factor
//! meets a destination alpha of one.
//!
//! Where the draw announces none of [`super::NOTES`], every channel is Metal's, a channel Metal
//! stores as a NaN any NaN where the draw announces `device-nan-encoding`: a device not measured
//! to store the blend's NaN as Metal's in a storage image (ANV, which stores `0xfe00`; before the
//! note, its draws stored that unannounced). On a device that fetches through the pixel interlock
//! (RADV, ANV, NVIDIA, MoltenVK) the function computes Metal's blend itself, exactly, announcing
//! none of [`super::NOTES`], which is asserted. Through input attachments
//! (lavapipe) the device blends, one and zero, added, too (announcing
//! `half-output-precision`, which Metal's kept product by zero there needs); what it announces and
//! how many channels are Metal's is printed.
//! Each draw prints a `FETCH-BLEND16-ZERO` line naming its function and blend. Before the shader
//! kept a zero factor's product, it dropped the term, which kept neither the NaN of an infinite or
//! NaN operand nor the zero sum's sign.
