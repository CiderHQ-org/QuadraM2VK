//! What an encoder was handed lives until its command buffer completes, on the device the cfg
//! selects, under the validation layer. Metal (with retained references) holds every object set on
//! an encoder until then: one a command used, one replaced or unbound before any command used it,
//! and one bound after the last command or with none at all. A command buffer never committed lets
//! go of them as it is released. (The M3 Max under macOS 27.0.1, probes `dealloc-probe` and
//! `dealloc-probe2`, 3 runs of each case: a no-copy buffer so bound to a compute or render encoder,
//! or under a texture so bound, then released by the program, ran its deallocator only after its
//! command buffer completed, never at the encoder's end nor while the committed command buffer
//! waited for an event; and after an uncommitted command buffer's release.)
//!
//! Each test binds no-copy buffers so, and a texture over one, releases its own handles while the
//! command buffer waits for an event, and checks that no deallocator ran until the command buffer
//! completed, and that each ran once by the time its wait returned, on a thread of the runtime's
//! (its command buffer's release); or, never committed, once it was released.
