//! The device's teardown against every holder of its objects, on the device the cfg selects, under
//! the validation layer: the program's last device handle goes before, between or after the objects
//! that hold the device, in every order, and the process neither crashes nor hears from the layer
//! (a destruction after the device's, or a leak at it).
//!
//! The holders: live variants that share the device's shader modules (two render states of the
//! same vertex function, one of them with an immutable sampler), a kept instance (a released
//! state's objects, which share those modules too), a variant taken back from the kept ones, and
//! an uncommitted command buffer whose draw holds the only handle of its state's variant, and
//! live and kept variants sharing the device's immutable sampler set, a host step's share of a
//! state's set, an uncommitted command buffer holding a shared set, and a draw's pipeline handed
//! to the device's pool, maybe still being made. On lavapipe the earlier rule (each module
//! destroyed itself through its own copy of the device's functions) crashed whenever a variant held
//! the last device handle: the teardown destroyed the device and the instance, the loader unloaded
//! the driver, and then the variant's modules called into it (SIGSEGV 10 of 10, `pass_start_reads`
//! and `extended_range_blends` included).
//!
//! The pipelines are the owned fixture `validation/fixtures/public/examples/runtime_examples.ll`.
