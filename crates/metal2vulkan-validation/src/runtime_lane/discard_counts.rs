//! Simdgroup operations after an MSL 2.2 discard on the device the cfg selects, under the
//! validation layer.
//!
//! The owned fixture `fragment_discard_counts` (compiled at MSL 2.2) draws Metal's fullscreen
//! triangle over an 8x4 `RGBA32Sint` target cleared to -7. Its `discard_counts` takes the
//! simdgroup's lane count before a discard and after it, and after it the count of lanes whose
//! quad keeps a thread, and a kept thread writes `(after - before, after - kept, before, after)`:
//! differences that hold whatever the simdgroup's size and however quads pack into it.
//!
//! Metal's answer, as an M4 gives it (from the fixture's AIR and from the
//! source compiled at MSL 2.2, with and without the debug layer), is `(0, 0, n, n)` in both modes:
//!
//! - **Half of each quad discarded** (`whole` 0, each quad's right column): a discarded thread
//!   runs on as a helper and stays a lane while its quad keeps a live thread.
//! - **Whole quads discarded** (`whole` 1, a checkerboard of 2x2 quads): a wholly discarded quad
//!   leaves the simdgroup, and is missing from the count before its discard too.
//!
//! The compile layer predicates the discard, so a discarded invocation stays a full participant,
//! and before each later non-quad simdgroup operation kills a quad whose every invocation is
//! discarded or a helper (the whole-quad exit). So every device counts Metal's lanes after the
//! discard. Metal's compiler moves the count ahead of the discard past it (nothing between reads
//! it or has a side effect), and canonicalization moves it there too (SEMANTICS 1094), so it also
//! counts Metal's lanes: every device gives Metal's answer in both modes. Before 1094 the count
//! ran ahead of the discard, counting the quads it drops (`Answer::BeforeCountsDroppedQuads`)
//! wherever a device packed a dropped quad beside a kept one.
