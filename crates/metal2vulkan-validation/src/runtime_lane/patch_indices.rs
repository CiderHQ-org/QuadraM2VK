//! Device tests of patch index and control-point index buffers on the device the cfg selects, under
//! the validation layer. The owned fixture `rt6_patch_index`, a `[[patch(triangle, 3)]]`
//! post-tessellation vertex function drawn with rasterization disabled in a 1x1 pass without
//! attachments, stores `ptag << 24 | patch_id << 16 | tag0 << 8 | tag1 << 4
//! | tag2` (its per-patch attribute, its patch index, and its three control points' tags) at mark
//! `tag0 / 3` of buffer 2. Control point `e` of buffer 0 (per patch control point) has tag `e`, so
//! without a control-point index buffer patch `p`'s points are `3p` to `3p + 2` and it stores at
//! mark `p`; patch `p`'s attribute in buffer 1 (per patch) is `0xa0 + p`; every patch's factors
//! are 1 but patch 3's, which are 0, so it culls.
//!
//! Each case's marks are those Metal stored (a Metal probe on an M4 with macOS 27.0.1, with and
//! without API validation): patch `i` of a draw with a patch index buffer is the patch its `uint`
//! at `patchStart + i` names, for its control points, its attribute, and its `[[patch_id]]`, while
//! its factors stay those at `patchStart + i`; control point `k` of the patch whose index is `p`,
//! drawn by `drawIndexedPatches`, is the index at `3p + k` of the control-point index buffer from
//! its offset, `ushort` or `uint` as the pipeline's `tessellationControlPointIndexType` states.
//! What Metal's validation stops of a patch index buffer is `patches.rs`'s; of a control-point
//! index buffer, this file's (probes 14d and 14e).
//!
//! Each test runs on the device's tessellation stages and on the emulation (`patches::Path`).
