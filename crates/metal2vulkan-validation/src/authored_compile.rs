//! The authored compile census: every committed authored case compiled without a device, with the
//! requests the engine executor builds for it, on each profile of a committed list, and
//! compared with the committed expectations.
//!
//! The plain translation census translates each row with no constants and no linked functions,
//! so a product change that breaks an authored case's own inputs (its constants, linked modules,
//! bind shape, dispatch, companion stage, or replay templates) passed it; only a device run
//! translated those inputs, and a case's committed device rows went stale instead of failing. This
//! census closes that gap:
//!
//! - **The request.** A case is admitted and prepared by the executor's own device-free half
//!   (`engine::prepare_case`), and every pipeline a run compiles before it reads device output
//!   comes from `engine::case_compiles`: the case's own, and on a device where the device
//!   replay runs, each registered replay variant. Each compiles in a compile worker (the 20-s and
//!   500-MiB per-attempt ceilings, a process-group kill). The pipelines of host-replayed commands
//!   are compiled for bind shapes the producer's records decide on the device, so they are counted
//!   per case and profile as uncovered, never compiled here; the count is part of the cell.
//! - **The bounds.** Each case is admitted, prepared, and compiled in its own case worker
//!   ([`CaseWorkers`]) under the 500-MiB ceiling, so the census's process holds only the
//!   committed cases and their cells; `jobs` cases run at once, each case's compiles one at a time.
//!   A case worker reads private sources by the byte ranges the census's index records
//!   (`source::use_source_index`), and parses a whole shard only for a source the index does not
//!   locate; the report counts both.
//! - **The profiles.** The profile-legs of the expectation file's header, each a committed profile
//!   as stated or in its robustness-off leg (`coverage::robustness_off`), derived under the
//!   default policy as every census row is. A device run compiles for the opened device,
//!   restricted to what the executor enables; this compiles for the committed profile.
//! - **The baseline.** The committed expectation file ([`EXPECTATIONS`] under the corpus root):
//!   one line per case, its cell on each profile-leg ([`Cell`]): `compiled` or the executor's
//!   stable refusal label (`NotSupported::outcome`), with its uncovered count when that is not 0.
//!   A run fails on any failure (an internal error, a worker stop, a case that does not check or
//!   map) and on any difference from the file: a compiled case refused, a refusal label changed,
//!   a refused case compiled, an uncovered count changed, a new case, a removed case. `--bless` rewrites the file and prints the same differences; it never writes a
//!   failure. `--bless-additions` ([`Mode::BlessAdditions`], what each train's gate runs) fails as
//!   a check does on any failure and on any changed cell of a case and profile-leg the file
//!   already holds, and otherwise writes the file with new cases and every C3 venue's missing
//!   profile-legs added and removed cases dropped: a new case has no baseline to flip from, and a
//!   removed case cannot regress.
//! - **The cache.** A table of the index holds each case's cell on each profile-leg under the
//!   census key ([`profile_key`]): the plain census's per-profile key (the product sources,
//!   `SEMANTICS_VERSION`, the profile's stem and fingerprint, the tools), the executor's ABI
//!   (which covers how it builds requests), and [`AUTHORED_COMPILE_CENSUS_VERSION`]. A case's id
//!   is content-addressed over its manifest (its AIR, linked modules, and templates by hash), so
//!   selection reads only the committed case shards and the table: a warm rerun admits, reads,
//!   and compiles nothing. Failures are never cached.
