//! The committed case and observation shards are in the layout the store writes.
//!
//! The store sorts every shard it writes through one key per row type (`ShardRow::order_key`):
//! cases by AIR then case name, Metal and candidate rows by case then environment. The store's
//! writers (`put_case`, `delete_named_case`, the upserts) are the only ones; no script or other
//! tool writes these shards. Each key is one slot, so a shard so written has
//! strictly increasing keys, and every row sits in the shard its AIR's hash selects. The readers
//! check slots and placement but not order, so a tool that appends rows instead of installing them
//! through the store leaves a shard the store would never write: 23b3bbbc did that to three
//! MoltenVK shards. Byte-level canonical form is not part of this check: rows of executor v34 still
//! carry the legacy `containment.device_addresses` field that a rewrite drops.
