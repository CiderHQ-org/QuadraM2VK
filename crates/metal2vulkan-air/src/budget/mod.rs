//! Per-attempt budget: deadline, cancellation, work units, byte ledger, structural caps.
//!
//! Deterministic caps are typed [`Limit`]s with their values here; exceeding one is
//! `Error::LimitExceeded`, permanent for the input. A [`Meter`] is created per translation attempt
//! and threaded (`&mut`) through every input-scaled loop:
//!
//! - [`Meter::tick`] at poll points: counts deterministic work units, then checks cancellation and,
//!   every 64 polls or 65,536 work units (`CLOCK_POLLS`, `CLOCK_UNITS`), the wall deadline. Only the
//!   deadline outcome (`Budget{Time}`) is transient.
//! - [`Meter::charge`] (or [`Meter::reserve`]) **before** reserving any input-scaled container, so
//!   the ledger is deterministic and refusal happens before allocation.
//! - [`Meter::cap`] / [`Meter::bound`] for structural counts.
