//! Barriers and fences: `air.wg.barrier`, `air.simdgroup.barrier`, `air.atomic.fence`.
//!
//! A barrier is `void (i32 mem_flags, i32 scope)` in AIR 2.8 and `void (i32 mem_flags, i32 order,
//! i32 scope)` in AIR 2.9 (deployment target macOS 27); a fence is `void (i32 mem_flags, i32 order,
//! i32 scope)`; every operand is an immediate. `mem_flags` is Metal's `mem_flags` mask
//! (`mem_device` 1, `mem_threadgroup` 2, `mem_texture` 4, `mem_threadgroup_imageblock` 8,
//! `mem_object_data` 16). A barrier's order is the `memory_order` MSL 4.1's barriers take (MSL
//! §6.10.1); Metal's headers pass `memory_order_seq_cst` to the barrier builtin in every earlier
//! language version, and AIR 2.8 drops the operand, so the 2-operand form is a `seq_cst` barrier.
//! Which form a declaration has is read from its type.
//!
//! The scopes differ by form. In AIR 2.8 a barrier's scope operand is both its **execution** and
//! its memory scope, read from the operand, never from the name: AIR also spells a
//! threadgroup-wide barrier through `air.simdgroup.barrier`. In AIR 2.9 the operand is MSL 4.1's
//! `thread_scope` argument, the **memory** scope alone (the threads that observe the ordered
//! accesses: MSL §6.10.1), and the name is the execution scope: `threadgroup_barrier`
//! (`air.wg.barrier`) synchronizes the threadgroup and `simdgroup_barrier`
//! (`air.simdgroup.barrier`) the simdgroup whatever scope they are given (Apple's compiler writes
//! `threadgroup_barrier(..., thread_scope_simdgroup)` as `air.wg.barrier` with scope 4). Metal's
//! headers pass the name's own scope in every language before MSL 4.1, so the two readings agree on
//! every barrier those spell. A value outside the modeled enumerations leaves the call unknown.
