//! ETC2 and EAC textures on a device without the formats: their blocks held as raw bytes in a
//! carrier, which copies move, and their samples read a decoded twin.
//!
//! - **Metal's answers** (an Apple M3 Max under macOS 27.0.1, our own probe: 4096 random blocks
//!   of each of the ten formats, every texel read as `float`): Metal reads them as
//!   `bind::EtcDecode` decodes them, an 8-bit channel `c / 255`, an sRGB form's colour through its
//!   twelve-bit table, an 11-bit channel `c / 2047` (signed `c / 1023`).
//! - **The store.** A device without `textureCompressionETC2` has none of the formats. Such a
//!   texture holds its blocks in an image of a *carrier*: a compressed format whose blocks are
//!   also 4 x 4 texels and of the same bytes (8, or 16 for `EAC_RGBA8` and the `RG11` formats),
//!   the first of [`CARRIERS_8`] or [`CARRIERS_16`] the device copies. Vulkan copies a compressed
//!   image's blocks as bytes, so the carrier keeps every block a copy writes, whatever its bits
//!   would mean to the carrier's decoder; its image is the texture's shape, so every region a copy
//!   names is the texture's.
//! - **What it serves.** Copies between buffers and the texture and between textures (fills
//!   included), and the CPU's copies, move its blocks through the carrier, so `getBytes` and a
//!   blit out of it hand back the blocks written. Its sampled views, of its linear and sRGB forms
//!   alike (the same codes), present its decoded twin (`texture/decoded_twin.rs`): Metal's decode
//!   of the blocks, decoded after each write as a BC texture's twin is, on the GPU
//!   (`bind::etc_decode_module`), or a host write's on the CPU. An 8-bit format's twin holds its
//!   codes, exact (an sRGB form's slots read them raw and decode them through Metal's table,
//!   `metal::texel_format::srgb_raw`); an 11-bit format's holds the texels
//!   `DevicePolicy::decoded_texels` names (`bind::EtcTexels`: 16-bit normalized codes, announced
//!   `decoded-texel-precision`, or Metal's values exactly). Announced `carried-decoded-twin`.
//!   Refused: a view of another decode (an `R11` or `RG11` format's other signedness;
//!   `Feature::TextureView`) and a sparse heap's texture (`RuntimeGap::DecodedHeapTexture`). A
//!   texture without a twin (a heap's over the caller's host pages or laid out apart from the
//!   heap's bytes) holds its blocks for copies alone, and a command that binds it for a read is
//!   refused. A shader write and an attachment take no such image: Metal's functions write no
//!   compressed texture, and no pass renders into one.
