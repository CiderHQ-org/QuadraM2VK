//! `command_buffer/kept_barriers.rs`: what a batch takes of a `VkQueue`'s kept barrier command
//! buffers (`QueueKept::take`) as the queue's timeline moves: a kept one only once the batch that
//! last took it completed, so none is pending twice; a list met twice in one batch, and a value a
//! failed submission left to the next batch; where a batch records its own, past the bounds; and
//! which list a new one replaces once the kept ones fill the places. One that writes a timed
//! command buffer's timestamps is kept per slot and taken again only by a later holding of the
//! slot, once its timestamps were read. The command buffers are handles the test makes: no device
//! records or submits them.
