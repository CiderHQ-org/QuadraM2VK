//! `command_buffer/completion.rs`: a command buffer's completion is seen as its work ends, while
//! other queues are in use and waited for; and `commit` returns while they are.
//!
//! The consumer's guest presented at about a quarter of Metal's rate under MoltenVK 1.4.1: the
//! completion waited for any of the timelines of the busy queue's first pending batch and
//! of every idle `VkQueue` in use, and MoltenVK's wait for any of several timelines loses a signal
//! that lands while it still registers a later one, so the batch was seen only when the 100 ms
//! wait ran out. These tests make that shape: four queues, three of them in use and idle, and the
//! fourth committing a few fills back to back each round, then waiting for the last. The
//! completion finishes the first and waits again while the next one's signal lands, its
//! moment swept across rounds by the fills' sizes, which is when a wait for any loses it.
//!
//! **The completion** (`a_completion_on_one_queue_is_seen_while_other_queues_are_waited_for`).
//! No completion waiter misses a wake: none of its waits runs out its 100 ms slice while the fence
//! or the timeline value it waits for is signaled (`WorkCounts::missed_completion_wakes`, read
//! after each round), which is how a lost wake shows, a command buffer then seen about a slice
//! late. A count is the runtime's own observation, which a loaded host does not make. On a device
//! that places its timestamps on the host's clock by a calibration (`gpu_time.rs`), a count in a
//! round whose command buffers were all seen within half a slice of when they could first be
//! seen is a signal in the slice's last moment, not a missed wake: printed, not failed.
//!
//! How late each command buffer was seen after it could first be seen is printed, not judged. It is
//! seen completed when its completed handler runs, which the runtime's threads reach from the
//! completion alone; it could first be seen at the later of its GPU end time and its kernel end
//! time where the device calibrates its timestamps, and at its kernel end time elsewhere (a device
//! that answers its GPU times from the host, or calibrates none, ends them where the completion was
//! seen). Under a test suite's load that delay is the host's scheduling, which holds Metal's own
//! handlers as long: on the M3 Max (macOS 27.0.1, at the utility quality of service the Mac lane
//! runs at) beside the runtime lane's tests at nextest's default parallelism, Metal's completed
//! handlers of this test's shape ran up to 82 ms after their `GPUEndTime` (15 of 1800 at 50 ms or
//! more), and the runtime's up to 57 ms after their kernel end, against 0.47 ms and 0.89 ms alone.
//! Neither the round's own time nor when the test's wait returned measures the completion: the
//! test's thread commits the round's command buffers before it waits for the first, so a commit the
//! driver holds holds that wait too, and neither the GPU's other work nor the driver's submission
//! is the completion's. On an RTX 3090 (NVIDIA 615.71.09) beside the lane tests' busy
//! kernels, rounds of 190 to 202 ms were submitted within 0.1 ms, their GPU work begun as long
//! after the commit, as another process's busy kernel runs, and each command buffer seen within 0.7
//! ms of its GPU end; and rounds of 57 to 64 ms ran their first command buffer's work at the commit
//! while the driver's submission of it returned 57 to 64 ms later, each command buffer seen within
//! 0.3 ms of that.
//!
//! **The commit** (`a_commit_returns_while_other_queues_are_waited_for`). Metal's `commit`
//! returns at once, and so does the runtime's: it hands the command buffer's batches to the
//! scheduler's thread and submits nothing itself (`scheduler/inbox.rs`), so a `vkQueueSubmit` the
//! driver holds never holds it. While commits submitted on the committing thread where the
//! scheduler was free, on the RTX 5080 Laptop GPU (NVIDIA 615.71.09) beside about 20 processes
//! opening devices 1 or 2 of a run's 1,800 commits took 58 to 226 ms, the GPU having run the work
//! within 0.1 ms, and on the M3 Max beside the full suite one took 51.4 ms.
//!
//! A commit's time is its wall time less the committing thread's waits for a CPU meanwhile, where
//! the kernel counts them (`timed_commit`): a wait for a lock, and work, stay in it, and the host's
//! preemption of the thread does not. Measured on lavapipe (Mesa 26.2.4): beside a batch's suites
//! (a load of about 48 on 16 hardware threads) one commit of a run's 1,800 took 117.8 ms of wall
//! time; beside 64 spinning threads on 24 hardware threads (a load up to 40), 20 runs of 20 passed,
//! the commits' waits for a CPU up to 2.9 ms and their times less those at most 85 us; and with
//! the scheduler's state lock held 120 ms by another thread while a round committed (a diagnostic
//! build), that round's first commit read 120.2 ms, none of it a wait for a CPU, and the test
//! failed, as it did beside 48 spinning threads (123.1 ms).
//!
//! Where the kernel counts no wait for a CPU (macOS: no `/proc`), a commit's time is its wall
//! time, the host's preemption of the thread in it: there a round with a commit that slow runs
//! again, timed afresh, and the test fails only where a commit of the round run again takes that
//! long too. A lock a commit waits for, held that long, is held again; a preemption seldom is: on
//! the M3 Max beside the full suite at the utility quality of service, two commits of a run's
//! 1,800 took 69 and 97 ms of wall time after handing off their batches, which the scheduler
//! submitted and the completion saw within 8 ms, while 20 runs alone held none over 63 us. With
//! the scheduler's inbox lock held 100 ms by another thread during one commit of every 100th
//! round and of its run again (a diagnostic build), the test failed on the M3 Max and on
//! lavapipe.
//!
//! **The wakes** (`a_queue_s_batches_wake_no_other_queue_s_waiter`). A queue's command buffers
//! wake their own `VkQueue`'s waiter alone, where it sleeps, and no idle queue's: over
//! [`WAKE_ROUNDS`] rounds of [`IN_FLIGHT`] fills on one queue, the notifies to the waiters
//! (`WorkCounts::wakes_completion_waiters`) number at most the command buffers, where waking the
//! idle `VkQueue`s' waiters at each batch's watch, wait and turn makes more than one a command
//! buffer. On a device of one `VkQueue` there is no idle waiter to wake, and it holds either way.
//!
//! A summary of the rounds' times, of how late each round's command buffers were seen, of how long
//! each wait returned after its command buffer was seen (what the wait adds), of the commits' times
//! and their waits for a CPU, and of the missed wakes is printed (`ROUNDS`), and each round that
//! took 50 ms or more, or saw a command buffer late, or held a commit that long, or counted a
//! missed wake, with its command buffers' commit times and waits for a CPU, kernel start and end,
//! GPU start and end, completed handler and wait's return, from the round's commit
//! (`SLOW-ROUND`).
//!
//! Device tests: compiled only under the validation crate's GPU safety cfgs (`m2v_gpu`,
//! `m2v_cpu_icd`), on the kind of device the cfg selects.
