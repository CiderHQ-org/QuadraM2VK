//! A merge of a shadowed `BGRA8Unorm` or `RGBA8Unorm` texture's writes reads the texels the
//! commands left from its shadow (`shadow_merge.rs`): through the shadow's own view, rebuilding
//! each byte from its unsigned normalized value (`bind::ShadowMergeRead`), where the shadow has no
//! unsigned-integer view, and through that view where it has one. Either way, the bytes are the
//! ones a copy of the texels into the merge's scratch gives (the form every other format takes).
//!
//! Each leg makes a [`WIDTH`]x[`HEIGHT`] texture over a `Shared` buffer, rows of [`ROW`] bytes
//! (not a multiple of 256, so a shadow wherever the device lays no image's rows so), whose texels
//! hold every byte value in each of their four bytes in each row ([`before`]), and the bytes
//! between its rows [`GAP`]. A compute dispatch writes the first [`WRITTEN`] texels of row 0
//! through it (`invert_texels`, of a source whose channels are 0 or 255, so its writes are exact:
//! Vulkan converts 0.0 and 1.0 to 0 and 255 exactly), texels that held, in turn, the word the
//! dispatch writes, that word with byte 0 changed, with every byte changed, and with byte 2
//! changed. Once the command buffer completed, those texels hold the dispatch's words and every
//! other byte what it held: a byte rebuilt wrong in any texel the dispatch left would differ from
//! the one kept, and the merge would write it there. The texture's merge fetched its texels
//! (`WorkCounts::shadow_merges_fetched`) and none went back as a copy.
//!
//! Device tests: compiled only under the validation crate's GPU safety cfgs (`m2v_gpu`,
//! `m2v_cpu_icd`), on the kind of device the cfg selects. The function is the owned fixture
//! `validation/fixtures/public/examples/runtime_examples.ll` (`llvm-as`).
