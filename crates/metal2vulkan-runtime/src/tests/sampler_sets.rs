//! The device's immutable sampler sets (`pipeline/objects.rs`): a layout's baked samplers are one
//! set per device for every variant instance whose layout bakes the same ones, counted against the
//! device's limit once, from the set's making until a program's call settles the device's map once
//! nothing else holds it; a host step takes the device's set and counts nothing, and on a miss
//! makes a set of its own that no lookup finds, gone at the map's next sweep or settle once nothing
//! else holds it (only the map destroys).
//!
//! A device test: compiled only under the validation crate's GPU safety cfgs (`m2v_gpu`,
//! `m2v_cpu_icd`), on the kind of device the cfg selects.
