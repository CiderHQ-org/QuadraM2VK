//! A compute encoder's dispatch whose `VkPipeline`s are being made (`pipeline/dispatch_making.rs`,
//! `pending_dispatch.rs`): Metal makes a compute state's pipeline at `newComputePipelineState`, so
//! a dispatch never waits for a compile, its command buffer completes in its queue's order, and a
//! command buffer of another queue that shares nothing with it runs meanwhile. The device's pool's
//! test hold (`pool::held`) keeps every making waiting here, so a making is as slow as the test
//! makes it.
//!
//! A device test: compiled only under the validation crate's GPU safety cfgs (`m2v_gpu`,
//! `m2v_cpu_icd`), on the kind of device the cfg selects. The kernel is `scale_and_offset` of the
//! owned fixture `validation/fixtures/public/examples/runtime_examples.ll` (`llvm-as`), as the
//! examples run it: `output[i] = input[i] * scale + i`.
