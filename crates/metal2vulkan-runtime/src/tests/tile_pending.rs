//! A render encoder's tile dispatch whose `VkPipeline` is being made (`render/pending_tile.rs`):
//! the dispatch returns once encoded, its pass records once the making lands, and its command
//! buffer completes in its queue's order with the tile function's stores, as Metal's, which made
//! the tile state's pipeline at its creation. The device's pool's test hold (`pool::held`) keeps
//! every making waiting here.
//!
//! A device test: compiled only under the validation crate's GPU safety cfgs (`m2v_gpu`,
//! `m2v_cpu_icd`), on the kind of device the cfg selects. The tile function is the owned fixture
//! `validation/fixtures/public/engine/k10ts_tile_grid.ll` (`llvm-as`): over an implicit
//! imageblock of an `R32Float` and two `R32Uint` attachments, each thread reads the 2x2 cells at
//! twice its position and writes `f * 2 + 1`, `v * 3 + k` (`k = 1 + x % 2 + 2 * (y % 2)` of the
//! cell) and a tag of its tile and cell.
