//! One making in the air per compile: twin makings, whose `VkPipeline`s differ only in what the
//! driver's compile of their functions does not read, take off one after the other.
//!
//! - **Twins.** Two makings are twins where their variants' content (`objects.rs`,
//!   `variant_content`: the layout and each stage's stage, entry point, flags, subgroup size,
//!   specialization layout and SPIR-V) and their specialization match ([`FlightKey`]): states
//!   that differ only in a color format, a blend or a vertex layout, say. On Apple's GPUs MoltenVK
//!   converts their SPIR-V to the same MSL and Metal's compiler service compiles it once, the
//!   second making finding the first's functions in Metal's own cache; made at once, each compiles
//!   them cold (the consumer's cold boot: a state's pipeline made right after its twin's took
//!   1.2 ms of MSL compile, where twins made at once each took the full compile).
//! - **Single flight.** A making that finds its twin in the air waits for it to land, then makes
//!   its own `VkPipeline` as before: each state still makes its own pipeline, driver record,
//!   creation log line and notices, and nothing of one making is handed to another. A failed or
//!   unwound making lands too, and its twin then makes its own. Only the order of the driver
//!   calls changes, which the program sees nowhere: Metal makes a state's pipeline within its
//!   `newRenderPipelineState` call whichever other state it compiles beside.
//! - **No turn held while waiting** (`budget.rs`). A making takes off ([`Flights::board`]) only
//!   once it holds its turn of the process's budget, just before its driver call, and lands when
//!   that returns ([`Leader`]); a twin waits for it holding no turn: a program's thread before it
//!   asks for one, a pool's piece by giving its thread's back for the wait
//!   (`budget::without_turn`). Every making in the air holds a turn and waits on nothing of ours,
//!   so each wait ends.
//! - **Bounded.** The table holds one key per making in the air, at most the budget's turns.
//! - **Counted.** A making that waited for a twin counts in `WorkCounts::flights_followed`.
