//! The device's pipeline layouts, each shared by every variant whose layout is defined alike
//! (`content_keyed.rs`): a variant's set layouts and pipeline layout are a share of the device's,
//! made by the first variant of that definition.
//!
//! Vulkan holds a pipeline layout compatible with itself for every set and for the push constants
//! (Pipeline Layout Compatibility: two layouts are "compatible for set N" where created "with
//! identically defined descriptor set layouts for sets zero through N" and "identical push
//! constant ranges"; one layout is all of that with itself). So where two variants share one, a
//! pipeline bind between their draws keeps what the draws before it bound and pushed with it
//! (`render/bound.rs`): the next draw pushes only the set-0 descriptors that changed, and leaves
//! out push constants of the same bytes, where each variant's own layout made it push them whole.
//!
//! - **Exact.** Keyed by all that `vkCreateDescriptorSetLayout` and `vkCreatePipelineLayout` take
//!   from a variant: each set's flags and whether its draws push it, each binding's number, type,
//!   count, stages and flags and the samplers it bakes, and the push-constant ranges. Two variants
//!   share a layout only where they would create identically defined ones. The baked samplers go
//!   by their handles: the device's set of the same descriptions (`objects::sampler_set`), or a
//!   host step's own, which no other key holds.
//! - **The device's, destroyed by its map alone** (`content_keyed.rs`): each layout holds the
//!   sampler set its set layouts bake until the map destroys it.
//! - **Counted**: `WorkCounts::pipeline_layouts_made`, `WorkCounts::pipeline_layouts_shared`.
