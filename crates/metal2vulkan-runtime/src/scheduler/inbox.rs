//! The scheduler's lock with an inbox, as a pure structure: a commit leaves its batches in the
//! inbox and returns at once, as Metal's `commit` does, and only the scheduler's thread makes
//! passes.
//!
//! A pass takes the lock, takes in what was committed, and submits what is ready, one
//! `vkQueueSubmit` after another (about 80 us each on ANV with i915, whose execbuffer lists every
//! memory object of the device), a few batches a pass (`scheduler/mod.rs`). No commit waits for
//! one.
//!
//! - **Posted, never passed** ([`Inbox::post`]). A commit puts its commit in the inbox and
//!   returns: the scheduler's thread takes it in at its next pass. The inbox keeps commit order,
//!   and every pass takes it in before anything else: so the order sees commits in commit order,
//!   and the batches go to the `VkQueue`s, and are planned, in the order a pass picks them.
//! - **Nothing left behind.** The thread is counted while it makes a pass (`passers`). Once done
//!   and counted out, it looks at the inbox again after a sequentially consistent fence, and
//!   makes another pass for what it holds. A commit puts its own in before the same fence and its
//!   look at the count: whichever of the two fences comes first, the later look sees the other's
//!   write, so a commit is either seen by the thread's look or finds no passer. One that finds no
//!   passer marks the state under the lock, which then only a short hold has (a wake, a decode
//!   count, the thread's look for work), for its caller to wake the thread, which takes it in.
//! - **The scheduler's thread looks again until its passes leave it work** ([`Inbox::pass`]).
//!   Its passes may leave it work to do without the lock first (a submission check, a host step),
//!   which the batches behind it wait for: it stops looking again at the first pass that leaves
//!   some, and before each piece of that work, passes again for as long as the inbox holds
//!   commits ([`Inbox::holds_commits`], `scheduler/left.rs`), and looks before it sleeps. A commit
//!   left to it, while it holds the lock for a pass, so waits for that pass, the submission
//!   handlers the thread runs right after it, and the pass that takes it in; never for a wake or
//!   the thread's work.
//! - **Who runs the after-work.** The thread lets go, outside the lock, of what its passes
//!   submitted (the holds, the submission handlers) in submission order.
//! - **A wake is handed off too** ([`Inbox::nudge`]). What a pass reads may change without a
//!   commit: an event's value rises, a batch completes (a check waits for its signal to land).
//!   Where the thread is counted, the waker leaves it a nudge and returns, as a commit does: the
//!   thread looks again for it once done, by the same fences, and each pass takes it in first.
//!   A completion turn so never waits for a pass's submissions before it finishes the batches
//!   it saw complete, whose completed handlers wait for it. A pass takes the nudge in by a
//!   sequentially consistent swap, which reads the waker's store where it takes that nudge, and
//!   so sees what the waker changed before it.
