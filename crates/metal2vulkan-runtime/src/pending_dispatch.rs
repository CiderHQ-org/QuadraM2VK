//! A compute encoder's dispatch encoded while a `VkPipeline` it records is still being made
//! (`pipeline/dispatch_making.rs`), and the recording of a dispatch's commands.
//!
//! - **What records later.** The dispatch's commands go into a `VkCommandBuffer` of their own,
//!   a segment of its encoder (`encoder.rs`, `deferred.rs`): the encoder's ends before it and a
//!   new one goes on after it. Everything else of the dispatch is done at the dispatch, as for
//!   one recorded there: its checks and refusals, its bindings and descriptor sets, its shadowed
//!   textures' copies in, its gates inside a block of command predication, its notices, its
//!   execution record (its pipelines' creation times set as it records), and its encoder's
//!   tracking of what it uses (`EncoderCore::command_later`), whose barrier the segment records
//!   first, as the encoder would have before the command. The segments lie between the
//!   encoder's `VkCommandBuffer`s in submission order, so the barriers the encoder records
//!   before its later commands order those after the dispatch as in one `VkCommandBuffer`, and
//!   nothing orders more than Metal asks. Only the recording of its commands, which name the
//!   `VkPipeline`, moves.
//! - **When it records.** `commit` records it where its pipelines are made by then; otherwise
//!   the scheduler's host step records it once they are made (`scheduler`), its batch held in
//!   its queue's order meanwhile, with no wait for the GPU: the batches committed after it on its
//!   queue complete after it, as Metal's do, and a batch of another queue waits for it only
//!   where the two share a resource one of them writes (`scheduler/order.rs`).
//! - **A failed making.** A making that failed, or that its state's release stopped
//!   (`piece_holds.rs`), is made again by the recording, as a caller after a failed making does
//!   (`making.rs`), on the scheduler's thread; where that fails too, the command buffer completes
//!   with `CommandBufferError::PipelineCreation`, its batch and those after it unrun, and
//!   `CommandBuffer::failed_pipeline` names the dispatch: its encoder's place and its order among
//!   the encoder's dispatches, the state, its variant and specialization, and the driver's error.
