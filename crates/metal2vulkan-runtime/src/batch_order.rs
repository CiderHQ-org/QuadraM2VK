//! How a batch of command buffers on one `VkQueue` begins after the batches before it there
//! (`DevicePolicy::batch_order`).
//!
//! Metal orders a command buffer after the earlier ones of its queue only where its work depends
//! on theirs: an independent fill committed behind a running fill of other bytes started while
//! the first ran, on an M3 Max under macOS 27.0.1 (probe `gpustart`). The exact form copies that:
//! a batch begins with a barrier for each access that depends on an earlier batch's of its
//! `VkQueue` (`tracker.rs`), its first encoder's GPU start written at the top of the pipe, and
//! ends with [`Barrier::to_host`], which orders only the host's reads and writes after it.
//!
//! Some drivers run no two kernel submissions of one queue side by side anyway. Measured with a
//! probe outside the runtime: batches A and B, each a command buffer of a start timestamp, one of
//! work and one of an end barrier and an end timestamp, signalling the queue's timeline, B's work
//! independent of A's; work of one workgroup of 64 invocations running a dependent multiply-add
//! chain of about 3 to 10 ms (so two run side by side in about one's time), or fills of other
//! buffers; with no end barrier, `to_host`'s or [`Barrier::to_all`]'s; in two `vkQueueSubmit`
//! calls or one; with and without the timestamps, the queries reset on the host or the GPU, and
//! with only the last submission signalling. On each of these, every shape ran B after A, in
//! about the sum of their times (20.0 ms for two 10 ms batches on the RTX 5080 Laptop GPU, 18.5
//! on the RX 7900 XTX, 20.0 on the UHD 770), where the same two dispatches recorded in one command
//! buffer ran side by side (10.0, 9.3 and 10.0 ms):
//! - ANV (Mesa 26.2.4) on the UHD 770 of RPL-S;
//! - RADV (Mesa 26.0.8) on the Radeon 780M and the RX 7900 XTX;
//! - NVIDIA's driver (615.71.09) on the RTX 5080 Laptop GPU.
//!
//! On those drivers ([`ends_order`]) the default form orders batches by their ends: every batch
//! ends with [`Barrier::to_all`], every write before every access of every later command of its
//! `VkQueue`, so the tracker plans no barrier after an access of an earlier batch there
//! ([`Tracker::by_ends`](crate::tracker::Tracker)), and a batch's start timestamp is written at the
//! bottom of the pipe ([`start_stage`]): once everything before it in submission order completed,
//! which is when such a driver starts it. A batch no longer needs a command buffer of barriers
//! for a dependency on the batch before it (on the UHD 770, with the consumer's frames over 520
//! host imports, 67.0 command buffers submitted a frame against 129.3 to 129.7), and runs as the
//! driver ran it before. Elsewhere, and under `BatchOrderPolicy::Exact`, the exact form.
