//! The reads the runtime's barriers name in their destination, from one table of the reads a
//! queue family's commands make ([`READS`], and [`EXTENSION_READS`] for what an enabled
//! extension adds), never `MEMORY_READ` or `HOST_READ` where they can be named: an image memory
//! barrier's, all made by [`image_barrier`] for the queue family that records them, whose
//! destination accesses are an [`ImageDst`]; and a global memory barrier's
//! ([`MemoryReads`], which `tracker::Barrier::record` names in place of `MEMORY_READ`).
//!
//! - **The device's accesses alone.** A command reads an image as a shader resource, an input,
//!   color or depth/stencil attachment, or a transfer's source; that is everything `MEMORY_READ`
//!   names after an image barrier whose destination stage is `ALL_COMMANDS` ("all read accesses ...
//!   valid where it is used"), and [`ImageDst::Every`] names exactly that. The host reaches no
//!   image's memory: it moves texels by copies, and a heap buffer's bytes reach the host through
//!   the global barrier that ends every batch (`tracker::Barrier::to_host` or `to_all`) or an
//!   internal submission (`texture::transfer_barrier`), which no image barrier stands for.
//! - **The recording family's reads.** `ALL_COMMANDS` stands for the stages the recording queue
//!   family supports, and an access mask may name only accesses those stages make
//!   (VUID-vkCmdPipelineBarrier-pImageMemoryBarriers-02820). So [`ImageDst::Every`] is the reads
//!   of the family's commands: a transfer's read on a family of transfers alone (the staging
//!   queue's, `device/staging.rs`), and a shader's read too on one of compute, and the attachment
//!   reads too on one of graphics. That is exact: on a family of transfers alone the only reads of
//!   an image after the barrier are transfers. A later access on another queue is not this
//!   barrier's to order: a semaphore wait orders it, whose "second access scope includes all
//!   memory access performed by the device" (the Vulkan specification, Semaphore Waiting), or,
//!   after the staging queue's work, the host's wait for its fence before that access is
//!   submitted.
//! - **Why not `MEMORY_READ`.** MoltenVK 1.4.1 takes `MEMORY_READ` or `HOST_READ` in the
//!   destination of a barrier into `GENERAL` of an optimal image bound to mapped host-coherent
//!   memory as a host read to come. Once the command buffer completes, a completed handler copies
//!   the texture into that memory (`getBytes`, `MVKImagePlane::pullFromDeviceOnCompletion`). A
//!   texture placed in its memory's `MTLHeap` lies in that same memory, so the copy writes its
//!   texels, laid out in rows, over its own storage, which the GPU lays out otherwise. The copy
//!   runs on the CPU while the GPU runs the submission's later command buffers. On an M3 Max,
//!   textures of a `Shared` placement heap read back permuted texels, or the heap's earlier bytes,
//!   where the copy came after the copies that wrote them (`runtime_lane::heap_textures`), with a
//!   texture's first move (`texture/first_move.rs`) asking for host reads. Every texture's first
//!   move, and every transition of a caller's image (`texture/wrapped.rs`), is such a barrier.
//! - **Global memory barriers.** A global barrier orders every read of memory a later command
//!   makes at its destination stages: an image's reads above, and those of a buffer alone, an
//!   indirect command's, an index's, a vertex attribute's and a uniform's, at stages of the family
//!   that make them; and the reads an enabled extension makes valid there ([`EXTENSION_READS`]:
//!   each extension of the Vulkan registry, vk.xml of Vulkan-Headers `vulkan-sdk-1.4.341.0`, the
//!   registry `scripts/regen-vulkan-requirements` pins, that adds a read access type or a stage a
//!   read takes). Named one by one beside the barrier's destination stages ([`MemoryReads`]) they
//!   are `MEMORY_READ` exactly: it "is treated as equivalent to setting all READ access flags that
//!   are valid where it is used", where an access is valid beside a destination stage mask only
//!   if a stage in the mask supports it, as the table of supported access types specifies
//!   (`VUID-vkCmdPipelineBarrier-dstAccessMask-02816`), and `ALL_COMMANDS` "specifies all
//!   operations performed by all commands supported on the queue it is used with", while the host stage "is not invoked by any
//!   commands recorded in a command buffer" (the Vulkan specification, Access Types and Pipeline
//!   Stages), so `HOST_READ` is none of them. Where an enabled extension makes valid a read only `VkAccessFlags2` names, which no
//!   `VkAccessFlags` bit covers (the runtime's barriers are `vkCmdPipelineBarrier`'s), the barrier
//!   keeps `MEMORY_READ`, and so does one on a family of none of graphics, compute and transfers.
//!   The extensions are those the runtime knows the device enabled: its own, and an adopted
//!   device's `RawDevice::enabled` and `device_extensions`. They are every extension whose
//!   commands the runtime records, and its barriers order its own commands: a batch's work reaches
//!   other commands through its signals, whose semaphore's "second access scope includes all
//!   memory access performed by the device" (the Vulkan specification, Semaphore Waiting). The
//!   runtime's global barriers record on its queues for encoders and internal work, every one of
//!   a family of graphics and compute (`device/create.rs`'s `queue_plan`), so their reads are
//!   that family's.
//! - **Why not `MEMORY_READ` there.** ANV (Mesa 26.2.4) takes `MEMORY_READ` in a barrier's
//!   destination as every invalidate it has, the aux-table invalidate among them; on the Iris Xe of
//!   RPL-P (Gfx12) that adds the render engine's idle sequence (a data cache, L3 fabric, render
//!   target and depth flush with a command streamer stall), a write of the aux-table invalidate
//!   register and a wait polling it clear, and the state and instruction caches' invalidates
//!   (`genX_cmd_buffer.c`'s `emit_apply_pipe_flushes` and `invalidate_aux_map`), at every such
//!   barrier. The named reads take none of them.
