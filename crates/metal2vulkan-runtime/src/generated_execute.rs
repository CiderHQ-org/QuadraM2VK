//! The generated-commands recording of an execution on the GPU alone (`gpu_execute.rs`), where
//! the device enabled `VK_EXT_device_generated_commands` and the product sets its path up for the
//! variants (`bind::replay_preprocess_generated`).
//!
//! - **What runs.** After the replay's preprocess and its barrier, per command of the range one
//!   `vkCmdExecuteGeneratedCommandsEXT` of the sequences the preprocess counted for it, a compute
//!   barrier before each but the first. Where the driver's own preprocessing of an execution after
//!   another goes wrong (`generated_commands::preprocess_apart`), the commands layout is made for
//!   explicit preprocessing: every execution of the range is preprocessed
//!   (`vkCmdPreprocessGeneratedCommandsEXT`) after the barrier, then a barrier, then the executions
//!   run preprocessed, so no preprocessing follows an execution.
//! - **Objects.** Per execution: each variant's indirect-bindable pipeline under the pipeline
//!   layout the variants share, the indirect execution set and commands layout, and the preprocess
//!   memory; the command buffer holds them until it completes.
