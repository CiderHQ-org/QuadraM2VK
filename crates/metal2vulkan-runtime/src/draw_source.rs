//! Where a draw reads its index buffer and its indirect arguments.
//!
//! Vulkan binds an index buffer at a multiple of the index size of its `VkBuffer` and reads
//! indirect arguments at a multiple of 4, and the binding layer bounds an index fetch at a
//! multiple of 4 bytes from the buffer's byte 0 (`IndexBufferRef::fetch_end`). Metal's offsets
//! meet these rules, but a no-copy buffer whose pointer misses 4 bytes has its byte 0 at no
//! multiple of 4 of its `VkBuffer` (`Buffer::base`), so the draw's offset there can miss them.
//! Such a draw reads a copy instead: `vkCmdCopyBuffer` takes any offset, so the bytes the draw
//! can read are copied into a new write-combined `Shared` buffer (`Device::write_combined_buffer`),
//! and the draw reads them there.
//!
//! - **Index fetches past the buffer**. Metal reads an index's bytes up to the buffer's length
//!   rounded up to 4 bytes (a partial last index reads the bytes past the length there: the
//!   padding, or a heap's bytes after a placed buffer), and draws each position from there as index
//!   0 plus the base vertex, bounded by the buffer even inside a heap (measured on an M3 Max and an
//!   M4). Vulkan states no value for an index fetched past the bound index buffer range, even under
//!   `robustBufferAccess2`, which only makes the fetch valid, so a direct draw whose positions run
//!   past where Metal's fetch stops reads a zero-padded copy ([`DrawSource::padded`]): the bytes
//!   before there copied to the start of a new buffer that holds every position, the rest zero, so
//!   every fetch lies inside the bound range and reads Metal's index on every device
//!   (`Degradation::IsolatedIndexBytes`). An indexed indirect draw, whose positions the arguments
//!   choose on the GPU, is bounded by the device's range only on a driver measured to read zero
//!   past it under `robustBufferAccess2` (`DriverFact::RobustIndexFetchReadsZero`), to which the
//!   vertex offset is added; elsewhere the index bounds pass draws it (`index_bounds.rs`). Where
//!   the device enabled `maintenance5`, that draw binds the range of the indices it reads alone
//!   ([`SizedIndexBind`], `vkCmdBindIndexBuffer2`), so the range ends where Metal's fetch stops
//!   reading the buffer, wherever its `VkBuffer` runs on (a heap's, past a placed buffer). Without
//!   it, `vkCmdBindIndexBuffer`'s range runs to the end of the `VkBuffer`, and a fetch past the
//!   buffer would read its padding, or the heap's bytes after a placed buffer: such a draw
//!   (`isolate`) reads a copy of its indices instead (`Degradation::IsolatedIndexBytes`).
//! - **The copy** of a misaligned byte 0 or an isolated fetch ends where its new buffer's
//!   `VkBuffer` ends: the new buffer is a multiple of 16
//!   bytes long, so its `VkBuffer` has no padding, and the bytes are copied to its end. An index
//!   position past them is then past the `VkBuffer`, where `robustBufferAccess2` reads zero. Where
//!   the draw reads indices to where Metal's fetch stops, which lies at a multiple of 4 from the
//!   buffer's byte 0, the byte 0 lies at a multiple of 4 in the copy too (elsewhere the draw reads
//!   no position past its bytes, so the binding layer's bound has nothing to bound). A copy of no
//!   byte (no whole index lies past the offset) leaves the 16 bytes zero and is read from their
//!   start: every position reads 0 there, and past them `robustBufferAccess2` reads 0 again. A
//!   padded copy lands at its new buffer's byte 0 (a multiple of 16 of its `VkBuffer`), and the new
//!   buffer holds every position the draw reads.
//! - **Ordering.** The copy is a command of the encoder's own command buffer, so it runs before
//!   the pass, between a barrier from everything before and one to everything after: it reads
//!   the bytes every earlier command left, as the draw itself would. Metal orders a render
//!   encoder's draws against each other's memory writes only through the program's memory
//!   barriers (`fence.rs`): where an earlier draw or tile dispatch of the encoder writes the
//!   bytes behind one, the copy runs before the draw's own render pass instance instead, after
//!   the writer's ([`CopySteps`]), and reads the write, as the draw does in Metal. A write since
//!   the last barrier races the draw's read in Metal. Before any barrier of the encoder, Metal's
//!   indexed indirect draw read the bytes from before the write in every run measured (a probe, an
//!   M3 Max and an M4), so such a draw whose arguments or indices a draw of the
//!   encoder wrote reads a copy of them taken before the pass for that reason alone
//!   ([`DrawSource::racing`]), announced once as `Degradation::UnorderedDrawBytes`. After a
//!   barrier, a rewrite since it was read in some runs, so no copy is taken
//!   there.
//! - **Bounds.** The copy holds every byte the draw reads inside the buffer: a direct draw's
//!   indices that lie wholly inside it, an indirect draw's arguments, or an indexed indirect
//!   draw's whole indices from its offset to where Metal's fetch stops, whose positions the
//!   arguments choose on the GPU. The binding layer is given the buffer's length past the offset
//!   (`DrawSource::length`), so it bounds the draw as it bounds it in the buffer; a padded copy's
//!   length is every position's, so it bounds none. The tracker takes the draw's read of the Metal
//!   buffer up to where Metal's fetch stops at most (`binding::command_uses`).
