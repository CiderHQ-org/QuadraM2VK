//! Decoded twins of BC1 to BC5 textures (the fitted decode).
//!
//! **Why.** Metal decodes a BC1 to BC5 block by rules of its own (`bind::BlockDecode`: 6-bit
//! weights, BC7's; fitted bit for bit on an Apple M4), which Vulkan leaves to the implementation.
//! A driver not measured to decode a format's blocks so (BC1 to BC3
//! `DriverFact::ColorBlockDecodeIsMetals`, BC4 and BC5 `DriverFact::ChannelBlockDecodeIsMetals`)
//! reads its texels up to a few 255ths off Metal's (`compressed-texel-decode`'s measured bounds).
//!
//! **The twin.** On such a device a texture of the format whose image is its own for good (in
//! memory of its own, or bound in a heap's own memory; [`Device::with_decoded_twin`]) keeps its
//! BC image, which every copy, blit and CPU access reads and writes as before, and beside it a
//! decoded twin: an image of the same shape, levels and layers, in memory of its own, holding
//! each texel as Metal decodes it (`BlockDecode::texel_format`: `R8G8B8A8_UNORM` codes for BC1 to
//! BC3, viewed as `R8G8B8A8_SRGB` where an sRGB form's own view reads; `R32_SFLOAT` and
//! `R32G32_SFLOAT` values for BC4 and BC5, which no 16-bit texel holds). Every sampled view a
//! binding takes of the texture, or of a view of it of the same decode (its sRGB twin), presents
//! the twin ([`Texture::decoded_view`]), so reads, samples and gathers read Metal's texels, which
//! the device filters as it filters the twin's format. The twin's format must take sampling, its
//! linear filter and copies on the device, else the texture has none.
//!
//! **Kept in step.** After every write into the BC image (`replace_region`, staged or submitted
//! now; a blit from a buffer, `fillTexture` included; a copy from a texture), the written region
//! is decoded into the twin by the decode's kernel (`TwinDecode::module`; [`DecodePass`]): its
//! blocks copied into a scratch buffer, decoded, and the texels copied into the twin, in bands of whole block
//! rows of at most [`BAND_BYTES`] of blocks and texels, which bound the scratch: the pass's own,
//! or for a pass the device's next submission takes, the device's ([`PassScratch`]). A new
//! texture's twin starts as its zero blocks decode (the zeros: BC1 opaque black, every other format
//! zero); a heap's texture, which holds what its bytes held, has its whole twin decoded before any
//! command reads it (a staged pass, `TexelCopy`).
//!
//! **Host writes decode on the CPU** (off the caller's thread). A `replace_region` whose blocks go
//! on the host or the staging queue queues the region's decode on the CPU
//! (`TwinDecode::decode_into`, the kernel's rules) for the device's decode thread, which copies
//! its texels into the twin the same way ([`Image::decode_written`], `twin_decode.rs`, announced
//! `cpu-block-decode`). A batch that may read the texture waits at its submission for that; one
//! submitted before the call and not yet complete makes the call wait for its decode, so it reads
//! Metal's texels of the new blocks. For that the twin is made as its BC image's CPU copies go:
//! with host-transfer usage, or shared with the staging queue, and moved to `GENERAL` there alone
//! as it is made, its texels started as the zero blocks' decode the same way, a constant fill
//! queued with the texture's making ([`Texture::start_decoded_twin`]). The runtime stages no GPU
//! decode of such a twin of its own: one in flight could read the old blocks before a later write
//! and copy their texels into the twin after that write's CPU decode. A blit's decode
//! (`decode_twin`) is the caller's command's, and covers only what it wrote, as Metal's write of
//! those texels would.
//!
//! **ASTC** (`astc.rs`): on a device without a texture's ASTC LDR format its blocks lie in a
//! carrier image and its twin holds Metal's decode in the texels `DevicePolicy::decoded_texels` names
//! (`TwinDecode::Astc`; an sRGB form's 8-bit codes under either, which its slots read raw and
//! decode through Metal's table), kept in step as a BC image's twin is (`bind::astc_decode_module`
//! on the GPU, `AstcDecode::decode_into` on the CPU): a pass's bands are of the texture's texels,
//! each band's blocks copied out of the carrier's texels over them. A new one's zero blocks read
//! magenta (an error block).
//!
//! **An ASTC texture's other colour space.** Metal views an ASTC texture as its `_sRGB` or LDR
//! form over the same blocks, whatever its usage, and the view reads what a texture of its own
//! format over those blocks reads (our probe on an M3 Max, macOS 27.0.1: reads and linear samples
//! bit for bit, footprints 4x4, 6x5 and 12x12). The two forms widen the endpoints apart
//! (`bind::AstcDecode`), so neither's texels follow from the other's: the first view of the
//! texture in its other colour space makes the carrier a second twin ([`Image::make_second_twin`]),
//! of that form's decode in the texels the policy names, in memory of its own, which the CPU
//! never writes. Its decodes are the GPU's, each recorded by a batch's submission
//! ([`SecondDecode`]): its whole decode as it is made, and a host write's, queued for the
//! device's next batch with work, which records them before its work, their uses joined to its
//! first part's, so the tracker orders them after earlier writes of the texture
//! ([`Device::take_second_decodes`]); a blit's write's, made as the blit is encoded where the
//! twin is there then, recorded by its batch after the blit's encoder ([`TwinWrite`]). A write
//! encoded before the twin was made has no decode: its batch leaves the texture's queued decodes,
//! the whole decode among them, to a later batch, which reads the carrier as the write left it.
//! Without a second twin a submission records nothing for such writes (counted:
//! `WorkCounts::second_twins`, `second_twin_checks`, `second_twin_decodes`).
//!
//! **PVRTC** (`pvrtc.rs`): on a device without a texture's PVRTC format its blocks lie in a
//! carrier too, and its twin holds their codes (`TwinDecode::Pvrtc`, `R8G8B8A8_UNORM`; an sRGB
//! form's slots read them raw and decode them through Metal's table), which serve the views of the
//! format's linear and sRGB forms alike. Each texel's colors come from the four blocks around it,
//! wrapping at the level's edges, so a write's decode is of whole levels (`twin_region`): on the
//! GPU (`bind::pvrtc_decode_module`), each band of a level's rows with all of its blocks, or a
//! host write's on the CPU (`PvrtcDecode::decode_rows`), a host write being of whole levels. A new
//! one's zero blocks read transparent black (an RGB format's opaque).
//!
//! **ETC2 and EAC** (`etc.rs`): on a device without the formats their blocks lie in a carrier of
//! the texture's shape, and the twin holds Metal's decode (`TwinDecode::Etc`): an 8-bit format's
//! codes (`R8G8B8A8_UNORM`; an sRGB form's slots read them raw and decode them through Metal's
//! table), which serve the views of its linear and sRGB forms alike, and an 11-bit format's texels
//! `DevicePolicy::decoded_texels` names (`bind::EtcTexels`). Each is kept in step as a BC image's
//! twin is (`bind::etc_decode_module` on the GPU, `EtcDecode::decode_into` on the CPU). A new
//! one's zero blocks read grey of codes 2 (`ETC2_RGB8`, and `EAC_RGBA8`'s colour, its alpha 0),
//! opaque black (`RGB8A1`), or an 11-bit value of 1 (signed -3), not zeros: the twin starts
//! cleared to them.
//!
//! **4:2:2** (`chroma_pairs.rs`): a `GBGR422` or `BGRG422` texture's texels lie in a carrier of
//! 2 bytes a texel, the texture's shape, and its twin holds Metal's texels (`TwinDecode::Chroma`,
//! `R8G8B8A8_UNORM` codes, exact), kept in step as an ETC2 texture's twin is
//! (`bind::chroma_decode_module` on the GPU, `ChromaDecode::decode_into` on the CPU). A texel's red
//! and blue read the pair beside it, so a write's decode is of whole rows (`twin_region`; a host
//! write of part of a row decodes its rows as the carrier then holds them, read back first). A new
//! one's zero pairs read opaque black: the twin starts cleared to it.
//!
//! **Without a twin**, announced `compressed-texel-decode` as before: a texture over the caller's
//! host pages or laid out apart from a heap's bytes (tiled, shadowed), a sparse texture, a
//! texture over an IOSurface or the caller's image, one whose twin's format the device lacks;
//! and a view of another decode (`BC4_RUnorm` as `BC4_RSnorm`), which reads the BC image.
//!
//! **Cost**, announced once per device (`decoded-block-twin`, performance): the twin's memory,
//! 4 to 8 times the blocks' (a BC1 texel's half byte against its 4-byte twin), and a decode pass
//! after each write. A `VkImage` handed out (`Texture::vk_image`) is the BC image: what the
//! caller writes into it outside the runtime's calls leaves the twin as it was.
