//! A multisampled depth texture held in the attachment layout between the render passes that
//! render it, on a device whose driver renders such a depth faster out of `GENERAL`
//! (`DriverFact::MultisampledDepthFasterOutOfGeneral`).
//!
//! - **Why.** On such a driver (ANV on the Iris Xe of RPL-P) a multisampled depth renders without
//!   its hierarchical depth in `GENERAL`, where every image of the runtime rests, and a move back
//!   to `GENERAL` after a pass costs a full resolve of the depth (about 1 ms at 1920x1080 with 4
//!   samples). A pass may hold the depth in `DEPTH_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT_OPTIMAL` for its instances
//!   (`render_target::depth_layout`); this keeps it there between passes too, until a command
//!   needs it in `GENERAL`.
//! - **Which.** A device's own `Private` texture ([`eligible`]): multisampled, of a depth or
//!   depth/stencil format, not memoryless (`TRANSIENT_ATTACHMENT`), with no depth twin. No host
//!   copy reaches it (Metal refuses the CPU a private texture's bytes), and never a heap's, a
//!   caller's image or a texture over a buffer, whose images other resources reach. Its `VkImage`
//!   is its own for good. The registry ([`HeldImages`]) knows each by its key from its making to
//!   its image's drop.
//! - **Where the moves go.** Only between encoders, in the device's submission order: the
//!   scheduler keeps each image's layout as the batches submitted so far leave it
//!   ([`HeldImage::current`]), and before an encoder that names the image (its commands' uses and
//!   bindings, `EncoderCore::named_keys`) moves it into the layout the encoder needs, in the
//!   encoder's command buffer of barriers (`command_buffer/submit.rs`): [`HELD`] for a render
//!   encoder that holds it, `GENERAL` for any other. A move is a write the hazard tracker orders
//!   as every write ([`HeldImage::transition_use`]), waits for other `VkQueue`s included. Nothing
//!   inside an encoder moves the image, so the order its commands are recorded in never matters.
//!   An image no encoder names stays as the last left it.
//! - **Which encoder holds.** A render encoder whose depth attachment is such a texture holds it
//!   only where nothing else in it touches the image: no command of its own named it before its
//!   pass's end, no step of its pass uses it but as the attachment, and its pass runs none of the
//!   steps that read or write the depth apart from its attachment (`render.rs`, the hold's
//!   decision). Its instances then render the depth in [`HELD`] with no move around them. Any other
//!   encoder keeps the depth in `GENERAL`, a render encoder of it moving it around each instance
//!   as before. A use other than the attachment's recorded after a hold is an internal error
//!   (`tracker::EncoderUses::broke_hold`).
//! - **What a program sees.** The texels: a layout transition keeps them ("The contents of any
//!   portion of an image subresource that is transitioned from one layout to another are
//!   preserved", unless the old layout is `UNDEFINED`; Vulkan's synchronization chapter). A read
//!   through a binding the program made registers its use (a slot's texture, or one made resident
//!   by `use_resource`), which moves the image to `GENERAL` before that encoder, whatever its
//!   usage says. A texture reached through an argument buffer without `use_resource` registers
//!   nothing, which Metal's contract does not allow.
