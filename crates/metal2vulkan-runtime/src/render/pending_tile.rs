//! A tile dispatch encoded while a `VkPipeline` it records is still being made, as a compute
//! encoder's dispatch is (`pipeline/dispatch_making.rs`, `pending_dispatch.rs`).
//!
//! - **A tile dispatch never waits.** One whose region's `VkPipeline` the tile function's variant
//!   has not made hands the making to the device's pool and goes on; a making in flight already
//!   is taken as it stands. Everything else of the dispatch is done at the call, as for one whose
//!   pipelines are made: its checks and refusals, its bindings and descriptor sets, its scratch
//!   images, its notices, and its execution record (its pipelines' creation times set as its pass
//!   records). Its makings rank from the dispatch on as a committed command buffer's
//!   (`Urgency::Committed`): its command buffer waits for them.
//! - **Its pass records later** where a making is still in flight, or failed, as the encoder
//!   ends, as the pass of a draw whose pipeline is being made does (`render/pending.rs`): `commit`
//!   records it where its pipelines are made by then; otherwise the scheduler's host step records
//!   it once they are, its batch held in its queue's order meanwhile, with no wait for the GPU. A
//!   pass whose makings all finished made as the encoder ends records then. A dispatch after the
//!   pass's instances recorded inline (`render/inline_first.rs`) records in the pass's segment,
//!   before its later instances, not in the command buffer the encoder hands over with them.
//! - **A failed making.** A making that failed, or that its state's release stopped
//!   (`pipeline/piece_holds.rs`), is made again by the pass's recording, as a caller after a
//!   failed making does (`pipeline/making.rs`); where that fails too, the command buffer completes
//!   with `CommandBufferError::PipelineCreation`, its batch and those after it unrun, and
//!   `CommandBuffer::failed_pipeline` names the dispatch: its encoder's place, its order among the
//!   encoder's tile dispatch calls, the tile state, its variant and specialization, and the
//!   driver's error.
//! - **Encoded again** (`replay.rs`): an encoder encoded again waits for its tile dispatches'
//!   makings in the rebind's call, as a compute encoder waits for its dispatches'.
